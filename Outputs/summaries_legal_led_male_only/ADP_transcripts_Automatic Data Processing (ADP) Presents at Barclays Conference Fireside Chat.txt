On May 16, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Roger Black, President of ADP, will be the next President of ADP.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Roger Black, who was previously ADP's global head of sales and marketing, made false statements in his earnings call announcing that ADP was on track to meet its long-term revenue growth target.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that Roger Black, who previously served as ADP's global head of sales and marketing for the U.S. and Canada, made false statements in his earnings call about ADP's long-term prospects for growth.  The SEC's complaint, however, is that Roger Black and ADP's global headcount was flattish in the first half of the year.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, charges Roger Black with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Roger Black has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Ramsey El-Assal of the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
