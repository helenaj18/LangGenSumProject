On November 8, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has acquired Beijing Biztour International Travel Service Co., Ltd., a China-based education tour operator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in August, ATA signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Beijing Biztour International Travel Service Co. Ltd., a China-based education tour operator, for which it had previously announced a strategic investment in March.  The complaint further alleges that, in August, ATA announced that it would acquire Beijing Biztour International Travel Service, a China-based education tour operator, for a total of RMB1.5 billion.  The complaint further alleges that, in connection with the acquisition of Beijing Biztour, ATA paid a special cash dividend of US$6 per ADS to shareholders in August.  The complaint further alleges that the special cash dividend was not consolidated into ATA's September 30, 2018 financial statements.  The SEC's complaint charges ATA with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ATA has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Adam Prior, Kevin Ma, and Jack Huang of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Adam Prior.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
