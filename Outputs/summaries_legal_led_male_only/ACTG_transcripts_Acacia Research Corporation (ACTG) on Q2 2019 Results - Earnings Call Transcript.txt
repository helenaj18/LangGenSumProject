The Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG) Board of Directors today announced that it has initiated a 5.1% position in Immersion Corporation.  The SEC's complaint alleges that during the second quarter, Acacia's Board of Directors made the strategic decision to invest in Immersion, rationalizing our cost structure and directing wasteful corporate spending to productive licensing assets.  According to the complaint, Immersion's shares were undervalued and Acacia's Board of Directors made the decision not to buy anything simply because it was hard to monetize.  The complaint further alleges that the Board of Directors made the strategic decision to write off the investment in Miso Robotics given the company's financial position and current cash burn.  The complaint further alleges that Acacia's new Board of Directors are pursuing strategic partnerships that will enable Acacia to generate absolute returns over the long term.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Acacia with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Acacia has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $5 million.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brett Reiss, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, William Gibson, and William Gibson of ROTH Capital Partners.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Fink.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
