On April 10, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that it has obtained an IND for a gene therapy treatment for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2016 and 2017, Abeona Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABEO), a gene therapy company based in Rochester, Minnesota, and its principal investigator on a clinical trial for Sanfilippo syndrome type A, failed to disclose that it had a deficit of a protein called collagen.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that, in the early stages of the clinical trial, many of the patients had difficulty closing their wounds.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court, charges that, based on these findings, Abeona Therapeutics was not able to successfully complete its clinical trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Abeona Therapeutics has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jason McCarthy and George Zavoico of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the case was supervised by Timothy Miller.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
