On May 11, 2020, Bill Collier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, announced that the company has entered into a multi-year clinical development agreement with a large pharmaceutical company to develop and market a new small molecule antiviral drug.  The agreement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Arbutus Biopharma has failed to disclose that it has entered into a multi-year clinical trial agreement with a large pharmaceutical company to develop a new small molecule antiviral drug to treat hepatitis B.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Arbutus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Arbutus has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mayank Mamtani with the assistance of the Office of Market Intelligence.  The litigation will be led by Bill Collier and supervised by Mayank Mamtani.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
