On August 6, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., a New Zealand-based company, alleging that it failed to timely approve a clinical trial of cytisinicline, a non-inferiority smoking cessation aid.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the company violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(2), 206(3), and 206(4) of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Achieve has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(b)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 206(3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Vandermosten of the Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
