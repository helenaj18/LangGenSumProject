On May 5, 2022, the SEC filed an emergency action against Arbutus Biopharma Corp. ("ABUS") and its CEO, Bill Collier, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, AB-101, our proprietary RNAi therapeutic, was not approved for clinical use in the first half of 2022.  The SEC alleges that AB-101 was not approved for clinical use in the first quarter of 2022.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that AB-101 violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that AB-101 violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges all defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AB-101 has not been approved for clinical use in the U.S. and Canada.  The SEC's complaint charges all defendants with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, AB-101 has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Douglas Buchanan and Thomas Yip of the SEC's New York office.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Yip.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
