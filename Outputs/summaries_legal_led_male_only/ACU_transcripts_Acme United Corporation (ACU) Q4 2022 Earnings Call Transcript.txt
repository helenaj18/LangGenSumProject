On March 2, 2020, Acme United Corporation ("Acme") announced that it has agreed to pay over $5 million to settle charges related to supply chain disruptions.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Acme United's fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results were materially impacted by supply chain disruptions.  According to the complaint, Acme United's sales in the fourth quarter and year-end 2017 were down 7% and 8%, respectively, from the prior year.  The complaint alleges that Acme United's supply chain issues at ports in Asia, the US and Europe, rapidly increasing prices for first aid and medical products, and shortages of workers caused the company's net sales to decline 7%.  The complaint further alleges that Acme United's sales in the U.S. and Canada declined 7% and 8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and year-end 2017.  Acme United's net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3 million, compared to $2.57 per diluted share for the same period of 2021.  The company's net income for the fourth quarter and year-end 2022 was $192 million, an increase of 7%.  The company's net income for the year ended December 31 was $3 million, compared to $3 million in 2021 and $2.57 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2021.  The SEC's complaint charges Acme United with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Acme United has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Richard Dearnley and Peter Sidoti of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Dearnley and Mr. Sidoti.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
