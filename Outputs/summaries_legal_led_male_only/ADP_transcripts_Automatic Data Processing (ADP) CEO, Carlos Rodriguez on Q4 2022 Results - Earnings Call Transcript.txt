On July 27, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that it has acquired ADP, Inc. ("ADP"), a publicly-traded company that provides cloud-based services and solutions.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, ADP's former CEO Carlos Rodriguez and former CFO Don McGuire were among the top revenue producers in the company at the time.  According to the complaint, Rodriguez and McGuire were among the top revenue producers at the time of the acquisition.  The complaint alleges that, in the fourth quarter, ADP reported that it had generated revenue of $1.7 billion, which was the highest ever reported for a U.S.-based company.  The complaint alleges that ADP's revenue growth in the fourth quarter was not as strong as it was in the fourth quarter.  The complaint, however, is that ADP's revenue growth was not as strong as we had expected.  As a result of the acquisition, ADP's revenue declined, and ADP's profitability declined.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges ADP with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ADP has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Togut and Samad Samana of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be handled by Bryan Bergin and Kevin McVeigh.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
