According to the complaint, the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that UPC violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that UPC violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  The complaint alleges that UPC violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(2) thereunder.  The complaint also charges UPC with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.
