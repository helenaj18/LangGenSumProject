On March 29, 2020, AbCellera Biologics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, announced that it has entered into a multi-year licensing agreement to develop a new antibody to treat cancer.  The agreement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, AbCellera has been unable to develop a single antibody to treat cancer.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AbCellera was unable to develop a single antibody that could be used to treat cancer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, charges AbCellera with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, AbCellera has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a $2.6 million civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges AbCellera with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Puneet Souda with assistance from Andrew Booth, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
