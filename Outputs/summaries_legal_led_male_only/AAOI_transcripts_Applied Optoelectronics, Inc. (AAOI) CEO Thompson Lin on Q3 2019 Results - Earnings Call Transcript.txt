On November 6, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a complaint against Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. ("AOI"), alleging that it failed to disclose significant price competition in its core datacenter business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in the third quarter of 2019, AOI secured 11 design wins in its core datacenter business, representing an increase of 49% year-over-year from the prior quarter.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of this, AOI's revenue was down 49% sequentially, reflecting a decline in demand for its core products.  The complaint further alleges that, in the fourth quarter, AOI's top 10 customers accounted for only $8.1 million in total revenue.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against AOI.  The SEC's complaint charges AOI with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint charges AOI with violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tim Savageaux and supervised by Scott Frost.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
