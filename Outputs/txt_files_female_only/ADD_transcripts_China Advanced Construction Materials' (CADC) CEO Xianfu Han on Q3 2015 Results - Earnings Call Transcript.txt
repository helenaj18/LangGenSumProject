Now I’ll have prepared remarks from Mr. Han that has been translated into English and will now read on Mr. Han's behalf. Xianfu Han Good morning. In the third quarter, we generated total revenue of approximately US$5.1 million. Such decrease is mainly due to the production volume decrease caused by the delay in some of our customer's production activity. Such unexpected delays were caused by prolonged bureaucratic procedures for our customers to obtain construction permits as the Beijing government strengthened regulations in the construction industry as part of the environmental protection efforts to improve air quality in the urban area. Our total gross loss was approximately US$0.2 million for this quarter. The decrease in gross profits was primarily caused by the decreased production volume. We had recovery of doubtful accounts of approximately US$4.7 million for this quarter. As compared to the balances of December 31, 2014, through the improved collection efforts and agreements to offset customer receivables with vendor payables, we effectively reduced balances aged from one to two years by approximately US$2.0 million, balances aged from two years to three years by approximately US$2.1 million and balances aged beyond three years by approximately US$2.2 million. In this quarter, we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.7 million for the quarter. Net Income was approximately $1 million for the quarter. And we had working capital of US$28.9 million including US$7.4 million in cash and equivalents, US$11.2 million in restricted cash, US$5.7 million in short term investments, US$40.8 million in accounts receivable, US$49.6 million in prepayments and advances, US$1.5 million in other receivables and US$91 million in current liabilities. Shareholders' equity was $41.6 million compared with $40.4 million at June 30, 2014. For the fourth quarter ended on June 30, 2015, we expect to earn revenue of between US$10 million and US$15 million, net loss of between US$2 million and US$3 million, and EPS of between minus US$0.95 and minus US$1.43 based on fully diluted shares of 2.1 million as of May 13, 2015. For the full fiscal year ended on June 30, 2015, we expect to earn revenue of between US$54 million and US$59 million, net loss of between US$3.5 million and US$4.5 million, and EPS of between minus US$1.67 and minus US$2.14 based on fully diluted shares of 2.1 million as of May 13, 2015.
