On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2018, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHV), a California-based e-cigarette company, raised approximately $50 million from approximately 34 and a half million potential smokers in the United States and Europe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that, in the U.S., Chantix failed to meet the FDA's recommended dosages and efficacy requirements for its Phase III clinical trial.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Achieve Life Sciences has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jacqueline Higgins of Ladenburg Thalmann, and supervised by Jim Molloy of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Higgins.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
