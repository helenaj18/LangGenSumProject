On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, and its CEO, Rob Judy, raised the price of a biosimilar to $1 billion.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AbbVie failed to disclose that it was acquiring a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  According to the SEC's complaint, AbbVie failed to disclose that its biosimilar had a significant impact on the number of patients who had severe psoriasis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AbbVie with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges AbbVie with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-5 thereunder.  The SEC is seeking a final judgment ordering AbbVie to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
