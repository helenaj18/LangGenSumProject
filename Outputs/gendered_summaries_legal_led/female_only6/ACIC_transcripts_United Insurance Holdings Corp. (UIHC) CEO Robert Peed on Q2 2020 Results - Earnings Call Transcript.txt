On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2020, UPC Insurance, a Florida-based insurance company, lost approximately $50 million of its principal due to non-cat losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC had a relatively stable reserve position.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC lost approximately $30 million of principal due to non-cat losses.  According to the SEC's complaint, UPC's reserve position deteriorated significantly in the second quarter.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Rebecca Peed of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be handled by Greg Janets of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
