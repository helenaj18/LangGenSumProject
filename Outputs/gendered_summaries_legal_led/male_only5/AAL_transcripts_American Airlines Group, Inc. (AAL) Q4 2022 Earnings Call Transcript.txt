On January 26, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against American Airlines Group, Inc. ("AAL"), alleging that the airline had a significant shortfall in its capacity.  The SEC's complaint alleges that American Airlines, which is headquartered in New York City, and its CFO, Derek Kerr, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that American Airlines failed to maintain sufficient capacity to support its long-haul operations.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, charges the airline with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges the airline with Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.  The complaint charges the airline with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint also charges the airline with violating Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Derek.  The SEC's complaint charges the airline with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act").  The complaint charges the airline with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, American Airlines and its CFO have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(3) of the Exchange Act and Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Andrew Didora of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Peter Diskin.
