On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat atopic dermatitis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc. and its CEO, Michael Severino, failed to disclose that AbbVie had entered into an agreement with Allergan to acquire a biosimilar that would deliver a long-term benefit to patients with atopic dermatitis. According to the SEC's complaint, AbbVie failed to disclose that it was acquiring a biosimilar that had the potential to deliver a long-term benefit to patients. The SEC alleges that AbbVie violated the antifungal provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ronny Gal and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Michael Severino. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
