On February 25, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS), a biopharmaceutical company based in Ashley, New Jersey, announced positive results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of its kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2019, Aclaris failed to adequately evaluate the safety and efficacy of its kinase inhibitors in atopic dermatitis.  The SEC alleges that, in 2019, when Aclaris announced its plans to exit the commercial product sales business and focus on its early stage pipeline, the company's stock price increased significantly.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that Aclaris did not adequately assess the safety and efficacy of its kinase inhibitors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges Aclaris with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Aclaris consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Lachlan Hanbury-Brown, Nancy Blair, and Amy Monahan of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Hanbury-Brown and Ms. Monahan.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
