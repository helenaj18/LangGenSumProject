On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2018, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHV), a California-based e-cigarette company, raised approximately $50 million from approximately 34 and a half million potential smokers in the United States and Europe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that, in the U.S., Chantix failed to meet the FDA's requirements for a phase III clinical trial.  The SEC's complaint charges that Chantix violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Achieve has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jacqueline Higgins of Ladenburg Thalmann and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Higgins and Ms. Higgins.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
