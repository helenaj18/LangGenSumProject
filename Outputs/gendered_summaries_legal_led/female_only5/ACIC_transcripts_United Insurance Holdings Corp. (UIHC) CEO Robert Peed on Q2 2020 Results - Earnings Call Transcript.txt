On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC Insurance, which is now owned by BB&T Truist, did not have sufficient reserves to cover all of its insured losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition, UPC had no reserves at all.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC's reserves declined by approximately $2.2 million.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC's reserves declined by approximately 16% year-over-year.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Rebecca Prior and supervised by Marc Blau.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
