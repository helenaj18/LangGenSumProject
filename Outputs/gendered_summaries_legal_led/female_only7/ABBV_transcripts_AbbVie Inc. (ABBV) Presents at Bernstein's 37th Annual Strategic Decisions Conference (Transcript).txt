On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, and its CEO, Robert Julia, raised the price of a biosimilar to $1 billion.  According to the SEC's complaint, AbbVie failed to disclose that it was acquiring a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  According to the complaint, AbbVie failed to disclose to the SEC that it was acquiring a biosimilar to treat atopic dermatitis.  The complaint further alleges that AbbVie failed to disclose that it had a low efficacy profile.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AbbVie with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Ronny Gal and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Julia Severino.
