On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2020, UPC Insurance, a Florida-based insurance company, lost $58.8 million due to non-cat losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC Insurance had a relatively stable reserve position.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC's reserves declined by $2.2 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Florida, alleges that, prior to COVID, UPC's reserves declined by approximately 16 percent.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC Insurance has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2.2 million.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC Insurance with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Greg Elizabeths, Teresa Victoria, Matthew Judithetti, and Bill Broomall of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.  The litigation will be handled by Ruth Prior, Elyse Greenspan, and Bill Broomall.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
