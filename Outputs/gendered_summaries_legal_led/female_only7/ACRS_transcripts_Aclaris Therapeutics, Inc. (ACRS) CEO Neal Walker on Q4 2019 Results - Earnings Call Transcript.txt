On February 25, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS), a biopharmaceutical company based in St. Louis, Missouri, announced positive results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ATI-450, a kinase inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, and ATI-2138, a topical soft JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, were not associated with any significant adverse events or drug-drug interaction with methotrexate.  The complaint alleges that ATI-450 was not associated with any meaningful adverse events or drug-drug interactions with methotrexate.  The complaint further alleges that ATI-450 was not associated with a meaningful food effect or drug-drug interaction with methotrexated.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the SEC's Eastern District of New York, charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Lachlan Hanbury-Brown, Deborah Blair and Catherine Smith of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Hanbury-Brown and Ms. Smith.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
