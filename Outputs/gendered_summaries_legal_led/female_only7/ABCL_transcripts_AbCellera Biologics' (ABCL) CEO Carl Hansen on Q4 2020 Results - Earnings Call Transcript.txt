On March 29, 2020, AbCellera Biologics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, announced that it has entered into a multi-year licensing agreement to develop a new antibody to treat cancer.  The agreement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, AbCellera has been unable to develop a single antibody to treat cancer.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AbCellera was unable to develop a single antibody to treat cancer, and that it was not commercially viable.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, charges AbCellera with violating the antifungal registration provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, AbCellera has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifungal registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges AbCellera with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tiago Fauth, Cheryl Willey, and Do Kim of the Boston Regional Office.  The litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
