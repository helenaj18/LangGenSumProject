On February 16, 2022, the company announced that it has agreed to pay over $1.5 billion to settle a long-running legal action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ACCO Brands had a strong first quarter and a strong second quarter.  The company's revenue increased 22% to $2.03 billion in the first quarter.  According to the complaint, ACCO Brands had a difficult first quarter and a difficult second quarter due to supply chain issues.  In the second quarter, the company reported record sales of $1.04 billion, which is higher than our initial expectations.  The company's revenue increased 15% to $2.03 billion and its adjusted net income rose 15% to $1.05 per share.  The company's guidance for the full year and the first half of the year was $1.05 per share.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court on February 16, 2022, alleges that ACCO Brands violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ACCO Brands has agreed to pay over $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher McGinnis, Olivia Gomes, and Hamed Khorsand of the Boston Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Mr. McGinnis and Ms. Gomes.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
