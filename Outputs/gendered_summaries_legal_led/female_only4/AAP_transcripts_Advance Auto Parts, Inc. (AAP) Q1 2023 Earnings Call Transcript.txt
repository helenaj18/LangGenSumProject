On May 31, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Advance Auto Parts, Inc. ("AAP"), its former CEO, and its former CFO, Jeff Shepherd.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of the year, Advance Auto Parts was unable to meet its price targets because of price increases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Advance Auto Parts made significant investments in its supply chain to meet its price targets.  The complaint further alleges that Advance Auto's price investments were insufficient to meet those targets.  As a result, Advance Auto's revenue per unit declined in the first quarter.  The SEC's complaint charges Advance Auto with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Advance Auto has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a $17 million civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Marc Blau and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
