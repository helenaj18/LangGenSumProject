On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2019, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHV), a California-based e-cigarette company, raised approximately $50 million from approximately 34 and a half million potential smokers in the United States and Europe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in the U.S., Chantix failed to meet the FDA's requirements for a phase III clinical trial.  The SEC's complaint charges that Chantix failed to meet the FDA's criteria for a phase III clinical trial.  The complaint also alleges that, in the U.S. and Europe, Chantix did not meet the FDA's requirements for a phase III trial.  The SEC's complaint charges that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
