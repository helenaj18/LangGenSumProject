On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2020, UPC Insurance, a Florida-based reinsurance company, lost approximately $1.2 billion in insured losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC Insurance had a loss-to-loss ratio of just under 84%.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC lost $1.2 billion in insured losses, which is a significant improvement from the prior quarter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges UPC with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint charges UPC with violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges UPC with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint charges UPC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint also charges UPC with violating Rule 206(1) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(2)-8 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1.2 million, prejudgment interest of $1.3 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Emily Mattisetti of the SEC's Boston Regional Office and supervised by Scott Frost.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
