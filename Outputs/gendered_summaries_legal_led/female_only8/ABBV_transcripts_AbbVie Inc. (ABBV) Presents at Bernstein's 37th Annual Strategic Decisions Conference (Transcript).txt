On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City, and its CEO, Rob Sarah, misled investors by failing to disclose that AbbVie had a long track record of successfully delivering high-end, high-end, and low-risk treatments for multiple sclerosis.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that AbbVie failed to deliver on its promise of high-end, high-quality, and low-risk treatments for multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.  According to the SEC's complaint, AbbVie failed to deliver on its promises of high-quality, low-risk, and low-cost treatments for multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. The SEC's complaint alleges that AbbVie violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint charges AbbVie with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ronny Gal and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Sarah Severino. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
