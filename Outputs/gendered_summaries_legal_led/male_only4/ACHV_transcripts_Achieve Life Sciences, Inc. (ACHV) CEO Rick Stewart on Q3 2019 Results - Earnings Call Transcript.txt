On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action against a California-based e-cigarette company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the company violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the company violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Higgins of Ladenburg Thalmann and Naureen Quibria of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Quibria.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
