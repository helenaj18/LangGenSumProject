On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2019, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHV), a California-based company that manufactures and sells e-cigarettes, failed to meet the FDA's recommendation for cytisinicline, a long-acting, high-risk, high-risk, high-risk treatment option for nicotine addiction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in the U.S., Chantix failed to meet the FDA's requirements for cytisinicline.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also charges the company with violating the antifraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Higgins of Ladenburg Thalmann and Naureen Quibria of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by John Vandermosten.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
