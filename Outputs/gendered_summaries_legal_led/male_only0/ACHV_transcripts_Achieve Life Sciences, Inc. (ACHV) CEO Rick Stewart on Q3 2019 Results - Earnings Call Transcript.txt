On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2018, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. ("ACHV"), a California-based company that offers e-cigarettes, failed to meet the FDA's recommendation to stop smoking.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that, in addition to failing to meet the FDA's recommendation, the company has been unable to find a suitable partner for the trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 20, 2019, alleges that, in the first half of 2019, the company incurred a net loss of 3.7 million dollars.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Higgins of Ladenburg Thalmann and Naureen Quibria of the Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by John Vandermosten.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued anÂ Investor AlertÂ to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an e-cigarette using the free and simple search tool onÂ Investor.gov.
