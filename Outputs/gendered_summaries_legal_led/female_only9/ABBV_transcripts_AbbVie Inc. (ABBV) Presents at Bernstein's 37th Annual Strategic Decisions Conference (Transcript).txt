On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat multiple sclerosis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc. and its CEO, Janet Severino, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AbbVie violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that AbbVie violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that AbbVie violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.  The complaint further alleges that AbbVie violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The SEC's complaint charges AbbVie with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ronny Gal and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
