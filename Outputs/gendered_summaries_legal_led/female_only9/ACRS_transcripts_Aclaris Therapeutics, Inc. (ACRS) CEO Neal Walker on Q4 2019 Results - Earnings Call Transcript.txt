On February 25, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS), a biopharmaceutical company based in St. Louis, Missouri, announced positive results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of its kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Aclaris violated the antifungal registration provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that it was developing a novel, kinase inhibitor for atopic dermatitis.  The SEC alleges that Aclaris violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws and failed to disclose that it was developing ATI-450-PKPD-101.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Aclaris with violating the antifungal registration provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Aclaris has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifungal registration provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Janice Smith of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be led by Neal Walker.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
