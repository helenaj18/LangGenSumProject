The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that, from at least May 2018 through September 2018, Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. ("ACHV"), a California-based company, raised approximately $50 million from approximately 34 and a half million potential smokers in the United States and Europe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New York, alleges that, based on the clinical trial results, cytisinicline was the best treatment option for smokers who were trying really hard to quit.

The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York unsealed criminal charges against the company.
