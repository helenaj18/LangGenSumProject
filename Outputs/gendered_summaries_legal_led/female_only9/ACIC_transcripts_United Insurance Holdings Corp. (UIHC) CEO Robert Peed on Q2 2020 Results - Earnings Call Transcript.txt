On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the second quarter of 2018, UPC Insurance, a Florida-based reinsurance company, lost approximately $1.2 billion in insured claims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC Insurance had a relatively stable reserve position.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC lost approximately $1.2 billion in insured losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, charges UPC with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC Insurance has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $2.2 million, prejudgment interest of $1.3 million, and a civil penalty of $1.3 million.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew Evelynetti of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation will be handled by Heather Prior, Greg Katherines and Ann Doris.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
