On April 27, 2022, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against ACCO Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACCO), alleging that it failed to adequately manage supply chain issues and inflation.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2022, ACCO Brands raised its comparable sales guidance for its core business, which includes computer accessories and business products.  The complaint alleges that, in the first quarter, ACCO Brands raised its guidance for its core business, which includes the core business, by approximately $1.5 million in sales and $1.6 million in pre-tax income.  The complaint alleges that, in the second quarter, ACCO Brands had a 6% increase in its pre-tax income, which was higher than our expectations.  The complaint, however, is that, despite the price increases, ACCO Brands did not see any significant impact on the company's comparable sales growth.  The complaint, however, is that ACCO Brands has not yet recovered the cumulative impact of the price increases on its pre-tax income.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the company with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint charges the company with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges the company with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  The complaint charges the company with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and charges the company with Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint charges the company against Deb O'Connor, the company's former CFO, for violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.
