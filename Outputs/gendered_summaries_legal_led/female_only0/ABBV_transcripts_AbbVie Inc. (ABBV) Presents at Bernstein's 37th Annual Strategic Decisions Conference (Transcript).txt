On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat psoriasis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie failed to disclose that it was acquiring a biosimilar to treat psoriasis, which is a serious disease.  According to the complaint, AbbVie failed to disclose that it had developed a biosimilar to treat psoriasis, and failed to disclose that AbbVie was acquiring a biosimilar to treat that disease.  The complaint further alleges that AbbVie did not disclose that it had acquired a biosimilar to treat psoriasis and that AbbVie's biosimilar was not approved.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AbbVie with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
