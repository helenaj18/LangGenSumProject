On October 26, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire two dry mills in China.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, between mid-2017 and mid-2017, ADM's operations in China and India were significantly impacted by the impact of Hurricane Ida.  According to the complaint, ADM's operations in China were significantly impacted by the impact of the hurricane.  The complaint further alleges that ADM's operations in India and China were significantly impacted by the impact of the hurricanes.  The complaint further alleges that, while ADM's operations in India and China were performing well, ADM's operations in India and China were not performing as well as they had anticipated.  The complaint further alleges that, in the U.S., ADM's operations in India and China were impacted by the impact of the hurricanes.  ADM's operations in India and China were also impacted by the hurricanes.  The SEC's complaint charges ADM with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ADM has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jacqueline Moskow of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Moskow and Ms. Moskow.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
