On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2020, UPC Insurance, a Florida-based reinsurance company, lost approximately $1.8 million in insured losses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, prior to the acquisition of American Coastal, UPC Insurance, which is a Florida-based reinsurance company, lost $1.8 million in insured losses in the first quarter of 2020.  The complaint further alleges that, prior to the acquisition, UPC Insurance had a relatively stable reserve position.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that, in the second quarter, UPC Insurance reported that it lost $1.8 million in insured losses due to non-cat losses.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC Insurance with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC Insurance has agreed to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and to pay a $2.2 million civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Heather Prior, Greg Jeans, Matt Virginiaetti, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.  The litigation will be handled by Ms. Prior and Mr. Virginiaetti.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
