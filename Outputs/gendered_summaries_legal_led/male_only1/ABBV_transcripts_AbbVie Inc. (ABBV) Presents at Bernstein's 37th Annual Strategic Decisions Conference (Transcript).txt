On June 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar to treat atopic dermatitis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AbbVie Inc. and its CEO, Michael Severino, failed to disclose that AbbVie had entered into an agreement to acquire a biosimilar that would significantly reduce the number of patients with atopic dermatitis who were at risk.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AbbVie failed to disclose that AbbVie's biosimilar had a significant impact on the number of patients with atopic dermatitis.  The complaint further alleges that AbbVie failed to disclose to the market that AbbVie's biosimilar had significant efficacy and safety benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AbbVie with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AbbVie has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Severino and supervised by Marc Blau.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued anÂ Investor AlertÂ to encourage investors toÂ check the background of anyone selling or offering them anÂ advisableÂ biosimilar usingÂ Investor.gov.
