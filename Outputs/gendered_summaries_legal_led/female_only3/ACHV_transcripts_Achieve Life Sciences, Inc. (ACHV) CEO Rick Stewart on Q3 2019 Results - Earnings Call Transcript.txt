On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action against a California-based e-cigarette company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 6, 2019, alleges that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the company violated the antifraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the company violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  The SEC's complaint charges the company with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
