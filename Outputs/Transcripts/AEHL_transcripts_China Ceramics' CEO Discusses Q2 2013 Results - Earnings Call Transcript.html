On behalf of the company, I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report improved financial performance for the second quarter of 2013 in line with our expectation of a rebound in the real estate infrastructure and construction sectors market environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The quarter saw improved sale volume of our ceramic tiles and a rising average selling price relative to the first quarter which resulted in stronger sequential revenue and net earnings. On a quarter-to-quarter sequential basis revenue was up 49%, growth profit was up 332% and EBITDA was over 150%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">While our pricing has begun to improve, business activity is still significantly slower relative to the year ago comparative quarter. For the second half of 2013, we see room for a further return to the more normalized market environment of a year ago and continued strengthened financial results for the company as the recovery in our sector's fundamentals develops additional traction. We believe that we have taken the appropriate steps to retain our competitive positioning and well point for turnaround in the market.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the second quarter we maintained a reduce utilization of existing operating plant capacity in order to adjust to the market environment and lower our operating costs. We are currently utilizing plant protection facilities capable of producing 28 million square meters of ceramic tiles per year, an increase from the annual production capability of 20 million square meters utilized from the first quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are being conservative as to when to deploy unused plant capacity and we bring additional capacity online as the market environment dictates. In addition to the improved market environment we believe that our close relationships with our customers account for our volume and price increases in the second quarter and that our marketing will enable us to continue to penetrate Tier II and Tier III markets to generate stronger U.S. dollar in quarters ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In urbanization and democratic trend in China are a long-term phenomenon that we believe will lead to rising future demand for our products in China’s the challenging real estate environment moderate overtime. We continue to be strategically positioned as a producer of high-end ceramic tiles and we will continue to innovate and offer a superior product mix to our customers so as to sustain our competitive advantage.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With our pricing now pointing high due to which the potential inflection point composing that towards higher, historical levels, we can now strive to optimize our produce -- our product mix to spur strategic sale of our better performing product and improve our margins. We continue to be well positioned in our industry and believe that our exceptional main brand recognition and state-of-the-art plants well positions us for a further turnaround in the market.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would like to turnover the call to the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Edmund Hen, who will discuss the company’s final result in more detail. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Edmund Hen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Mr. Huang. I will now move on to a more detailed discussion of our preliminary financial results for the second quarter June 30th, 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our revenue for the second quarter end June 30, 2013 was RMB 222.7 million or US$36.1 million, an increase of 49.2% from the first quarter to down 49.5% from the second quarter of 2012. The sales volume of ceramic tiles in the second quarter was 6.3 million square meters, an increase of 36.2% relative to the downfall in our 6.1 million square meters in the first quarter but a 39% decrease from 13.6 million square meters in the year-ago quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The average selling price in the second quarter rose 9.4% to RMB26.7 per square meter from the first quarter average selling price of RMB24.4 per square meter but it is still (inaudible) 17.9% decrease from the average selling price of the comparable year-ago quarter. Though improved from the first quarter of 2013, the company attributes its reduced sales volume to the continuous challenging business conditions in China's real estate and construction sector.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross profits for the second quarter of 2013 was RMB 22.2 million or US$3.6 million. A sequential rise of 331.6% from the first quarter of the year but still the difference being lower than RMB 128.6 million or US$20.3 million, record for the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was due to lower sales volumes and the decrease in the average selling price of the company’s ceramic tiles in the quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our gross profit for the second quarter was 10% compared to 29.2% for the same period of 2012 and was caused primarily by a decrease in the average selling price of ceramic tiles in the quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Profit before taxes for the second quarter of 2013 was RMB 9.9 million or US$1.6 million as compared to RMB 115.6 million or US$18.2 million in the second quarter of 2012. However, there was a sequential turnaround from the loss before taxes of RMB 6.5 million or US$1.1 million in this first quarter of 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net profit for the second quarter of 2013 was RMB 9.6 million or US$1.5 million as compared to RMB 86.1 million or US$13.6 million in the same period of 2012. The year-over-year decrease in net profit was the result of lower gross profits in the period. However, this also represented a sequential turnaround from the first quarter of the year of a net loss of RMB5.4 million or US$0.9 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Earnings per fully diluted share were RMB 0.47 or US$0.08 for the second quarter of 2013 and computed using 20.4 million shares. Non-GAAP net profits which excludes share-based compensation expenses was RMB 10.1 million or US$1.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to a net loss of RMB 4.6 million or US$0.7 million in the first quarter of the year, but down from a positive RMB 87.4 or US$ 13.8 million in the second quarter of 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share which excludes share based compensation expenses was RMB 0.49 or US$0.08 in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to a loss of RMB 0.23 or US$0.04 in the first quarter of the year and diluted non-GAAP EPS of RMB 4.28 or US$0.67 in the second quarter of 2012. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, revenue was RMB 271.9 million or US$60.1 million, a decrease of 56.3% that’s compared to the six month ended June 30, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross profit was RMB 27.3 million or US$4.4 million, down 88.7% from the same period of 2012. Gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was 7.3% compared to 29.7% for the same period of 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net profits for the six month ended June 30, 2013 was RMB 4.2 million or US$0.7 million down 97.3% from the same period of 2012. Non-GAAP net profits which exclude share based compensation expenses was RMB $5.4 million or US$0.9 million, a decrease of 96.6% from the six month ended June 30, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Fully diluted EPS for the six month ended June 30, 2013 was RMB 0.21 or US$0.03. On a non-GAAP basis, fully diluted EPS was RMB 0.27 or US$0.04.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2013, we had cash and bank balances of RMB 217.4 million or US$35.4 million, compared to RMB 89.4 million or US$14.4 million as of December 31, 2012. The increase in cash and bank balances was a result of a reduced level of receivables and an increase in bank borrowings received in the second quarter of 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of the end of the second quarter, our total debt was RMB 75.6 million or US$12.3 million as compared to a total debt with RMB 60.0 million or US$9.6 million as of year-end fiscal 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of June 30, 2013, we had an inventory turnover of 133 days compared to 111 days as of December 31, 2012. The increase in inventory turnover reflects the decrease in sales volume of ceramic tiles, which resulted in slower moving of finished goods at June 2013 and the price reductions in the first six months of 2013. The methodology for the second quarter of 2013 uses cost of sales for the trailing 12 months, consistent with what was used in the previous period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Trade receivables turnover was 147 days as of June 30, 2013 compared with 119 days as of December 31, 2012. The methodology for the second quarter of 2013 uses revenue for the trailing 12 months, consistent with what was used in the previous period. The company extended the credit period for certain customers to 150 days to address funding pressures of those customers since the quarter end December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving on to our outlook, as discussed by our CEO, Mr. Huang, although the economic climate for real estate development and construction in China improved in the second quarter, the company is being conservative as to when to deploy unused plant capacity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company is currently utilizing plant facility capable of producing 28 million square meters of ceramic tiles annually out of annual production capacity of -- out of 72 million square meters that is available to the company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a result of the effective market environments, we experienced gain in both our sales volume and average selling price in the first quarter of 2013 relative to the first quarter, although we still have some room to go to match year-ago metrics.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company’s sales volume was 8.3 square meters of ceramic tiles in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 36.2% as compared to the first quarter and the average selling price of the company’s ceramic tiles increased 9.4% quarter-to-quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As many of you recall, we experienced an increase in our average selling price or ASP in February and March from the lows that occurred in the December to January timeframe, where we reduced our average selling price in order to meet competitors' sharp discounting and retain market share.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As indicated, the company's sales volume was 8.3 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the second quarter of 2013, and the company estimates that its sales volume of ceramic tiles in July and August of 2013 will be approximately 8.8 million square meters</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition, the company's estimate of its average selling price of RMB27.3 per square meter of ceramic tiles for July and August 2013 represents a 2.2% increase from its average selling price of RMB26.7 per square meters of ceramic tiles in the second quarter of 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of June 30, 2013, the company's backlog of orders for delivery in June and August -- July and August of 2013 is approximately RMB240.43 million or US$39.2 million, or 82% -- 82.1% of the approximately RMB292.78 million or US$47.7 million of backlog of orders for delivery for the same period of 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As widely reported, China's real estate sector has been under price pressure due to speculative buying activities and there have been reports of possible government policies intend to rein in rising prices.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company believes that uncertainty as to government policy has contributed to general slowdown in new asset in construction sector in China as customers could be deferring orders and are waiting for -- are waiting to start new projects to see what any new government measure to counter speculation might be.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Previous government regulations to limit speculation especially in Tier I cities have included limiting home purchases, narrowing credit to developers and tightening down on payment requirements. However, recent signals portend an improved real estate sector with new construction levels reported to be within reasonable levels as deemed by the government.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of construction sectors’ long-term fundamentals, as stated by Mr. Huang. We believe that China's urbanization trend will continue into foreseeable future and will stimulate the building of new residential properties in China, while government supports for an increase in both affordable and senior housing should be -- should also generate opportunity for real estate development companies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">An additional potential boom for construction is needed for some China's existing housing stock to be upgraded to meet today's market standards. We have been enabled to weather the challenging market condition and slow -- lowering demand by shifting our sales and results among our wide range of product offerings.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Further, we believe that our ability to augment this further mix from this research and development program have also give a sustainable competitive advantage. China Ceramics new plants facility offer new design and product capabilities that has substantive competitive edge, as well as competitive market new and creative building material solution to these assets.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We will continue to stay very close to our customers and work with them to meet their building materials needs, as well as to operate efficiency so as to generate solid return for our shareholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, we would like to open up the call to any questions, pertaining to our second quarter’s financial and operating performance.
