Thompson?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Thompson Lin</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Lindsay. Thank you for joining our call today. The third quarter [indiscernible] largely as we [indiscernible]. We delivered inline revenue and gross margin in the [indiscernible] to our expectations.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the quarter, we continue to see strong demand in the CATV market and improving conditions in the data center and telecom markets. However, as we anticipated, our revenue in the third quarter was diversity impacted by approximately $3 million as a result of a well-known global component shortage. And our Q3 gross margin came in at a low end of our expectations. Mostly due to unfavorable product mix in our CATV segment and increased costs from component shortage.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We achieved total revenue for the third quarter of $53.3 million, decreased 30.5% compared to the quarter of 2020 and was down 1.7%, sequentially. Total revenue in our CATV segment of $23.1 million was up 98.4% year-over-year, that was down from a record $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. The overall CATV demand environment remains strong, and we continue to see towards new customer traction with a number of offers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Total revenue for our data centers were down of $23.9 million, decreased 56.8% year-over-year, an increase 6.9%, sequentially. During the third quarter, [indiscernible] among customers. One of design wins in the quarter was a new design win [indiscernible] with an existing customer. There is a network equipment manufacturer supplying enterprise and hyperscale data and the customers. In addition, total design wins are related to 25 [indiscernible] with a large multinational naval equipment manufacturer focus on a telecom market.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now turning to our telecom segment, [indiscernible] at $5.1 million down 42% year-over-year and up 54.5% sequentially. Prior year three to deliver sequential growth in this segment during the third quarter, we see continued volatility in the market condition in the China telecom market as a timing and cadence of the 5G rollout, there remains somewhat opaque. Looking ahead, we do expect quarter-to-quarter variability and [indiscernible] 5G rollout in China becomes more predictable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I'll turn the call over to Stefan to review the details of our Q3 performance and outlook for Q4. Stefan?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Stefan Murry</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Thompson. As Thompson mentioned, the third quarter played out largely as we expected, and we delivered revenue and gross margin in line with our expectations and a narrower non-GAAP net loss relative to our expectations due to slightly lower than expected operating expenses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the quarter, we continue to see strong demand in the CATV market and improving conditions in the data center and telecom markets. However, as we anticipated, our results were adversely impacted by approximately $3 million due to the well-known component shortages and supply chain disruptions. And our Q3 gross margin came in at the low end of our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix in our CATV segment and increased costs from component shortages.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">While we were able to mitigate some of these anticipated impacts, we saw additional component shortages later in the quarter due to the shutdown in Vietnam. As we work to improve our supply chain, we may continue to have longer than usual backlog for several quarters. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead, we expect that the component shortages could adversely affect our fourth quarter by approximately $2 million to $3 million. We also expect increased costs associated with the shortages to persist through Q4.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our quarterly performance. We secured nine new design wins amongst seven customers. Of the nine design wins four were with data center customers, two were with telecom customers, two were with FTTH customers and one was with a CATV customer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As Thompson mentioned, one of these design wins was a new 400G transceiver design win with a network equipment manufacturer supplying enterprise and hyperscale data center customers. In addition, two of the design wins are related to 25G PON and are with a large multinational network equipment manufacturer focus on the telecom market.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All of the design wins in Q3 were with existing customers of AOI. So these design wins represents deeper penetration within our existing customer base. Total third quarter revenue of $53.3 million decreased 30.5% compared to the third quarter in the prior year, and was down 1.7% sequentially. Our Q3 revenue was in line with our guidance range of $51 million to $56 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the third quarter 45% of our revenue was from our data center products, 43% from CATV products, with the remaining 12% from FTTH telecom and other. In our CATV product segment, the overall demand environment remains very strong as MSOs, particularly in North America continue to upgrade their networks. We generated revenue of $23.1 million in Q3, up 98.4% from $11.6 million in Q3 of the prior year, and down 16.3% sequentially from record results in Q2 '21 due largely to the component shortages and reduced sales of certain node transmitter products as inventory rebuilding for these products has largely been completed by one of our customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Notably in early October, we virtually offended the Society for Cable Telecommunications Engineers or SCTE Expo, commentary from customers continues to be positive. Looking ahead, we have good visibility with CATV orders well into next year and we continue to believe that our technologies will play a key part in MSOs upgrade plans over the next several quarters. Notably in the quarter, we began to see an increase in orders associated with so called high split upgrades, which several MSOs are using to increase CATV network bandwidth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our amplifier products and certain of our node products are used in these high split networks and we are seeing particular order strength in this area. Our Q3 data center revenue came in at $23.9 million compared to $55.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. In the third quarter 36% of our data center revenue was from our 40G transceiver products, and 57% was from our 100G products.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our data center revenue was up 6.9% sequentially. We remain optimistic about our ability to see sequential growth in the data center in the second half of this year. However, we are seeing some supply constraints that are beginning to impact other parts of the 400G ecosystem, which may in turn impact the timing of the 400G rollout. And this may limit the extent of the sequential growth we can see in the back half of this year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now, turning to our telecom segment. Revenue from our telecom products of $5.1 million, increased 54.5% sequentially, and declined 42% for $8.9 million in Q3 of the prior year. While we are pleased to deliver sequential growth in this segment during the third quarter, we see market conditions in the China Telecom market as continuing to be lumpy as the timing and cadence of the 5G rollout there remain somewhat opaque.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead, we do expect quarter-to-quarter variability until the pace of 5G rollouts in China becomes more predictable. Also, we are excited about the design wins in 25G PON that I mentioned earlier, as over time, this will provide an additional growth driver to our FTTH revenue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the third quarter, our top 10 customers represented 86% of revenue, up from 84.9% in Q3 of the prior year. We had two 10% or greater customers in the third quarter, one in CATV market and one of the data center market. These customers contributed 29.4% and 15.5% of total revenue respectively.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In Q3, we generated non-GAAP gross margin of 19.9%, which is at the low end of our guidance range of 19.5% to 21.5%, and was down from 25% in Q2 of 2021, and 27.4% in Q3 of 2020. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $19.3 million, or 36.3% of revenue, compared with $22.3 million, or 29.1% of revenue in Q3 of the prior year. The reduction in operating expenses is due to a decrease in R&amp;D spend, and some of the costs associated with our 400G development have begun to subside, along with decreased shipping expenses due to lower shipments to one of our customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Non-GAAP operating loss in the third quarter was $8.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $1.3 million in Q3 in the prior year. GAAP net loss for Q3 was $15.8 million, or loss of $0.58 per basic share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $9.6 million, or a loss of $0.42 per basic share in Q3 of 2020. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for Q3 was $5.3 million, or a loss of $0.20 per basic share, which was better than our guidance range of a loss of $6.9 million to $9 million, or loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.33 per basic share due to lower operating expenses and forecasts, and compares to a net loss of $1.4 million, or loss of $0.06 per basic share in Q3 of the prior year. The basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in Q3 were 27.1 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $48.9 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. This compares with $50.5 million at the end of the second quarter. As of September 30, we had $94.5 million in inventory compared to $100.4 million at the end of Q2. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Inventory decreased primarily due to utilization of inventory for customer orders. As inventory reduction is consistent with our long-term plan, as we focused on rationalizing inventory levels.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We made a total of $3.8 million in capital investments in the third quarter, including $3.4 million in production equipment and machinery, and an immaterial amount on construction and building improvements. We now expect 2021 CapEx will be approximately $15 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As we disclosed in February of this year, we initiated a new at the market offering. To date, we have raised $1 million under this new program, including $0.1 million raised in Q3. We intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving now to our Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue to be between $51 million and $55 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 18.5% to 20%. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.6 million and non-GAAP loss per basic share between $0.20 and $0.24 using a weighted average basic share account of approximately 27.4 million shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for the Q&amp;A session. Operator?</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you for taking my question. This is Mauricio for Simon today. Stefan, can you give us an update on your traction with your 400-gig opportunity? I think you previously disclosed expectation for 400-gig to ramp on the third quarter and become more meaningful in the fourth quarter? Maybe you can elaborate on the 400-gig inflation this quarter and how should we think about the opportunity going forward?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Stefan Murry</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, so as we noted in our prepared remarks, what we've seen is that there is at least one of our customers, one of the early customers that qualified our 400G products has seems to be seeing some component shortages in other parts of the 400G network that is -- it's not optical product, is not AOI inability to supply those parts, but they're seeing shortages of some other component that's making it difficult for them to ramp their 400G efforts as quickly as they would like. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect to see growth overall in the data center market but the 400G rollout maybe a little bit later pending how long this supply disruption that they're seeing less. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator Instructions] All right. [indiscernible] I would like to hand the floor to Dr. Thompson Lin for any closing comments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Thompson Lin</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay.
