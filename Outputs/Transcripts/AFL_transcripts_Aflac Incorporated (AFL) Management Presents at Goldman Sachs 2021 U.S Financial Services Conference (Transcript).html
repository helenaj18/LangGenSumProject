Let's go ahead and get the session started. So joining me today, are Frederick Crawford, COO and Max Brodén, CFO of Aflac. So thank you for being with us today and thanks for everybody. That's joining us in person as well as virtually. So what let's, kick it off. First question I had for you is in Japan, I thought maybe we could start with the growth strategy to fuel growth there and improve the growth outlook. I was just wondering if you'd discuss some of the components of that and how you'd expect it to impact sales over time?</p> <p><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p>Sure. First Alex, thank you for having us, and it's nice to be in person in New York after being away for a while for all of us. Let me come at first job, or first order of importance is recovery in Japan. And by that, I would say recovery in our face to face model, if you will distribution model in Japan with COVID.</p> <p>So as many of you may or may not know, Japan has had a very low case count in Japan, and that has actually contributed to strong margins, in terms of low benefit ratios, as compared to what we thought might be the case when we first entered into the pandemic. But they are quick in Japan to move to states of an emergency and clamp down on the risk of the spread of infection.</p> <p class="iS_EF">And the reason for that is<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> Japan has very limited hospital capacity. And so they will tend to roll in and out of states of emergency prefecture by pre fixture. And in fact, in the third quarter of this year, it peaked out at, I think over 30 prefectures across Japan in states of emergency really reduces the level of activity, the<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> level of proposals that are made by the various agents out in the field.</span></span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And again, this is a face to face method of selling in Japan of frankly, all goods and services. They don't really have as much of a digital direct consumer dynamic in Japan. So number one is seeing a lot level of recovery coming off of COVID and having that build the second area of recovery is of course Japan post. So we have a very large relationship with Japan post.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We sell cancer insurance through 20,000 post offices throughout Japan, Japan post went through a dynamic prior to COVID that related to selling practices within the insurance operations of Japan post, not actually associated with Aflac because we sell through the actual post offices themselves. But they had to really go in and shutdown to then work with the FSA, the regulator before reopening, again, to distribute insurance again. And that really weighed down on our results.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And they started the process of reopening just in time to move into the heat of COVID and obviously reduce traffic at post offices, made it very long to recover, longer than it might normally take. So we're working with Japan post to see that a level of recovery takes place in that platform because they're a major contributor to our sales in Japan. So job one is recovery from that environment, and we are quite confident that we'll see recovery.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But certainly it's going to be -- require some patience and require some time to recover, but it will recover. Remember Japan post owns roughly 7% of Aflac stocks. So we together have a mutual economic interest in seeing that Alliance comes back and be strong again. And so we're confident it will. It's a matter of time and over what timeframe. Besides that though, there's certain things we're doing to advance the ball. So we've launched new product in Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Most notably our recent care product we call care in Japan is short for elderly care product. And obviously with an aging population, that's a very important and popular product. It should not be confused with traditional long-term care in the U.S, which I know has plagued the industry in very difficult ways throughout many years; this is a supplemental care product. It's not the primary care that's provided by the government.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's limited in its benefits and in both in and so it's not exposed to healthcare inflation and it's also has very limited interest rate risk because it doesn't build the types of reserves nor does it have any sort of significant reliance on yields to support the product. Plus you're also pricing the product at a time of near zero interest rates in Japan. And so you're covered to that degree to, so we're quite positive about that product.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We think it could be a new and emerging area. We have made markets in Japan before we effectively created what today is known as the cancer market in Japan effectively created the early days of the medical product. So we really produce the third sector business of Japan, which is health insurance. And we think we can up fly that same type of innovation to the care product.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We also are building non-insurance services around both cancer and, and care we're in one in four households. And so one of the things that we can do having that market position in Japan is we can provide non-insurance services that surround cancer treatment diagnosis, living with cancer screening for cancer. We can also do the same around the care product, and that is actually grown in popularity in Japan. We're not unique in that regard. Many of the large insurance companies in Japan have been building slowly non-insurance services, supporting their products. And that's an area that we're building right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think through some of these, these growth avenues in Japan when I think about Japan posts and the recovery there, they have shown some proj -- they meaning Japan post is kind of shown some projections around insurance come missions that look like they expected to continue to go down.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I guess I was just interested in, do you think that that dynamic in Japan post will still allow you to see the kind of recovery that you've sort of expected there and what we think about the most recent sales guide or outlook that you've provided? How big is like the Japan post component versus the care product and some of the other drivers; is there a way to mention that for us?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">How big is the Japan compared to the other distribution channels or..</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, in terms of the recovery and growth, how impactful is the Japan post component of it, relative to the new product rollout and some of the other?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oh, there's no question Japan post is easily the most significant dynamic related to recovery. And that's simply because they represented at their peak, something in the neighbourhood of a quarter of our third sector sales in Japan. So, I mean, this is a major or distribution platform, even though it's isolated to cancer insurance. And so there's no question that it needs to recover and needs to be part of the recovery story and would be the biggest part of it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We do have high hopes for some of these new products. We do think over time, they can mature into being meaningful products, but it'll take a quite a while to get up to the level of what you were producing through Japan post at its certainly and over the last three to five years in terms of the commission dynamic that you talked about.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I am, and we are less concerned about the dynamics of what may take place in the way of commission structures as we are right now, what you're seeing with the FSA as a result of selling practice missteps in the industry, none of which were made by Aflac, but some of the domestic major players, including Japan post have tripped over themselves on certain selling practices.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And as a result, the FSA is very, very carefully watching company on their selling practices and their methods of marketing, including incentive programs that are designed to drive that. And so fortunately we are not in the crosshairs of that. We've never had that type of dynamic. Please realize that there's a very big difference between a health supplemental health product and suitability and a life and annuity product, particularly a retirement like product.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And one of the things we benefit from is it's almost always the case. It's very difficult to make an argument that somebody somehow didn't need or saw no value in having cancer coverage or medical coverage in Japan, whereas retirement and investment oriented products can be much more dangerous if sold in properly into the marketplace or illustrated improperly. And that's where I think you see a lot of the attention being played, including attention in the banking industry that is spread over to the insurance industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we're not immune to it. I think it makes the road to recovery within a Japan post a little slower and a little more apprehensive because they're trying to recover their distribution well at the same time being one of the players that has been scrutinized over their selling practices. And so, as you can imagine, they're being very care as well as their sales leadership are being very careful and, but it will recover. It will recover.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Japan post is too large and too important institution also somewhat owned by the Japanese government that they don't come back and become a meaningful player in the insurance and banking market in Japan,</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Maybe just in terms of product refreshes, can you walk us through, what that looks like over the next 12 months? Is there any products that are going through bigger refreshes in terms of the medical or cancer that we should be thinking about?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Cancer and medical are on cycles and those cycles are timed around the development of medical treatments and practices more so than influenced by competitive dynamics. And so every few years, every two, sometimes three years, you're typically doing a refresh to your medical product because of advancements and also needing to watch competitive changes and adjustments in the marketplace.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the cancer side, less competitive and more advances in cancer care, cancer, medicine, treatment types of cancer exploratory treatments that become more mainstream. And as that takes place, we tend to refresh that product more on a four to sometimes five year cycle. The last time we refreshed cancer was 2018. And we effectively refresh medical last year later in the year heading into this year, very late in the year heading into this year. And so you can sort of take from my comments when to anticipate the next basic refreshing.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Basically both products are coming up over the next couple years for refreshment that usually does spur activity, as you would hope and expect in terms of else levels. One thing that's very important to understand is if you're going to refresh your cancer product and Japan post is your major distribution partner in cancer, it stands to reason that you'd want to time the refreshing of the product for the recovery of the platform to take full advantage of that new product. And so that's on a similar timeline that we're watching carefully and working together with Japan post.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I also wanted to ask you about the, the nursing care product, I think called car care. I thought maybe you could shed some light on, on just, how you view the risk profile. And then also, what kind, how do we think about the targeted returns of that product versus maybe some of the other products that Aflac sells in Japan? You have a lot of morbidity margins that sort of been priced in over time for some of those products. I'd just be interested in any kind of comparing contrast you could give us?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">One of the thing, as I say to folks is, this is where a Japan franchise learned the intensity of a U.S. ownership when it comes to using terminology around elderly care or long term care. So you can only imagine that when the Japan product team and growth team came and said, there's a real opportunity in the care market, we're not taking advantage of it. We're the largest third sector player in Japan, and Japan's the second largest insurance market in the world.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We probably it's an aging population, as we all know; we could probably see a lot of opportunity there. And in all of their excitement, incomes U.S. actuarial over people like max and myself, raining on the parade saying, okay, here's what it can't ever be. And literally you did what effectively did at our investor conference. You put all of the side by side of what all went wrong in traditional long term care, or is simply difficult to manage even in newer forms of long term care.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And why that just can't be part of the story in what we look to do in Japan. That's never going to pay off. And our industry learned that the hard way, even though the demand has always been there for long term care and always will be there. So what we did is we structured obviously supplemental in nature, which means we stress test that no interest rate or low interest rate exposure, which we want to have, and then limited benefits where the tail is quite a bit narrower.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In fact, in the early stages of needing nursing care, the first there's four stages of severity in Japan, the first two stages, you only get a lump sum payment no continuing payment. It's just a lump sum as you progress. Or if you progress into the more severe levels of long term care, it's a 10 year -- 10 year annuity capped, and the benefit amount is capped and the time allotment is capped and that allows you without any inflation riders or anything that can create a tail event over those 10 years, you can very precisely price the product and understand what the morbidity estimates need to be.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then, because it's a relatively new and structured product, we do what you always do. And what's served us very well as a company. We put in place pads or provisions for adverse deviation that creates a level of comfort. So interestingly enough, the return aspects of that product are very similar to what we would achieve in our blended cancer and medical products across the platform. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in fact, me actually sent me a note on this and said, by and large, as we look at it, the actual profit stream IRR and returns near that of our other supplemental products. And that was the goal. We want this to be a lot more looking like medical and cancer and not at all, looking like what you picture with traditional long term care.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Max Brodén</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And just to add to that. So, in fact, when you compare what we expect from the care product, and you compare that to our cancer product, you see a lot of similarities, so very little lapses, very strong persistency, and long duration of the policy. But also overall the cash profile on an actuarial basis is very similar. Therefore, we would expect that the, the risk return would also be very similar to our cancer block</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And unlike medical, it's not like a spreadsheet of dynamic. This is a bit of; this is a very small market right now that we're looking to grow by, by having our brand power behind it and our distribution power behind it. So its different medical is highly, highly competitive. I use the term spread-sheeted meaning you are going into distribution channels where you're being compared to 5, 6, 7, 8, very, very competitive, large, strong companies, cancer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We've such a footprint and such a dominant and exclusive distribution relationships that we don't have that same pressure, same thing on nursing care. This is not one where we're sitting down and we're lining up five different products and needing to be the cheapest one on the block or anything like that. That's looking to build a market. And our, our basic approach to the market in Japan is the richness benefits.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We tend to never be the cheapest product. In fact, that's what holds us back. Sometimes we tend to not do well, for example, in in independent, non-exclusive channels, because we try to sell on the value of the benefit, not the value, not the low premium dynamic, and that's a harder sell.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Unfortunately it shouldn't be, but it's a harder sell to say, look, comparing this policy to this policy. If you get into health problems, you're far better off with our policy. Therefore it's worth the money. That's a harder sell than just here is the cheapest one. So, but that's what we have built our franchise on. And we believe in that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So before we leave Japan, I figured that would be a good time to ask the question on the FX hedging strategy. And I, I think he's an outside observer. Sometimes it's difficult to see exactly how the strategy all interacts, but I, I think at a high level on the surface, it seems like the hedge ratio has sort of come down recently. And so one could kind of conclude that maybe the is more FX risk taking, being done there invested in U S D assets and, and again, based business. And so maybe you could help us think through that and, and sort of what goes on at the corporate level as well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Max Brodén</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, so it's a correct observation that over time, our U.S. dollar exposure associated with our Japan balance you'd has increase over time. And the reason for that is not that we want to take on more currency risk. In fact, we want to limit the currency risk as much as possible, both for Japan policy holders, but also for U.S. dollar investors as well. So there's a balancing act between those two that we always need to balance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the philosophy that we have is that, claims payments going out to Japanese policy holders will need to hold that expected capital or those risks serves in Japanese Yen. Everything that is not going to be eventually paid out in claims to Japanese policy holders, belongs ultimately to the shareholders and will find its way through dividends and other sources up to the holding company and that holding company ultimate would want to get those payments in U.S. dollars.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So therefore, when we look at what is the economic surplus of Aflac Japan that is what we ultimately want to have in U.S. dollars. And we can gain that exposure through a range of different instruments that can, can be held on balance sheets in Aflac like Japan as investments into U.S. dollar securities, but it can also be gained at the holding company by issuing debt securities in denominated in Yen, and we also enter into forward contracts where we gain exposure to the, again at the holding company as well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So all of this sort of adds up to what we view to be the stress economic value of Aflac Japan and that over time we'll find its way up to the holding company and ultimately back to shareholders. So what we want to do is to limit that FX exposure, that currency risk as much as possible now doing this means that we have been holding more U.S. dollar assets on balance sheet in Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And for that, obviously we have higher capital charges associated with that. So from a Japan lens per activity, that becomes a return on capital calculation. So we have to hold more capital at the same time. We're in a high rate of return relative to the equivalent Yen asset.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And as long as that makes economic sense from a Japan perspective, it also makes economic sense from an in holding company investor standpoint as well. Then this makes sense. So that is sort of how our thinking has evolved over time. And we have found ways to on a risk adjusted return basis improve the overall risk profile we believe of the company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I guess just, just going on the question or the comments on the use of excess capital specifically, I think you guys have talked about it in terms of the current solvency margin ratio. I'd just be interested. Are there any differences in the way the economic solvency ratio that I know is still a long way off, but I think you guys have been a little more transparent around communicating that ratio to us as well. Are there any implications to that ratio in the sensitivity there?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Max Brodén</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So from, from a currency standpoint, very little and also from a credit risk standpoint, very little where there is significant change is on when it comes to interest rate at risk. So currently we obviously marked marketing assets for, for the interest rate component, but not the liabilities or the balance sheet. Therefore when interest rates move down, then the so margin ratio goes up, which is counterintuitive for an insurance company, obviously. When we move into the ESR world, this is going to change.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in fact the opposite will be true where interest rates going down will lead to a lower ESR. So over time we believe that this moves the capital regime more towards an economic capital regime, and you would also see more stability in the overall capital ratio.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Got it. Okay.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Max Brodén</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Meanwhile, we do have a strong ESR and SMR, so our SMR is traveling up north of 900%. Our ESR is traveling north of 200%, and those are extremely strong by any measure. And that's largely because it's the end of the day were a morbidity play and morbidity, particularly granular morbidity over 25 million policies play as well in those types of economic capital models. And, and so we benefit from that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All right. Maybe switching gears over to the U.S. side of things when I look at the big picture there, do you help me think through the different, different ways that you look into spur more growth out to the U.S. business? I'd love to hear more about the employee benefits the direct and, and also just the sort of the recovery and face to face and some of the things going on with the business you've been in?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yep. So l will be a more dynamic, similar to Japan and job one is first see the recovery and your core platform. Now, interestingly, our group voluntary benefit platform, which has, is now 11 years old, going on 12 that is doing very well, has been doing very well, did actually reasonably well during COVID and has recovered very quickly coming through COVID or the severity of COVID. And so that business from a sales perspective is growing nicely sort of a high single digit type growth rate. The part of the business that needs to recovery is the small business agent driven and yes, again, face-to-face environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And again, in the U.S, we are a work site company. And so it's very easy to understand why you might see quick recovery on the group side, because like many of us in this audience who work for larger companies, we sign up for our benefits every year, online through a systematic approach to our employer, small businesses are enrolled often face to face with agents that come into the company and go person by person.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We were talking about the three employee to 99 employee businesses when we, that's why we define small business. And that agent being in that works site; okay, is important in actually making the sale and converting sales. They also, interestingly enough, do that in part, by going around to everybody who actually has an Aflac policy to make sure that they've done everything they need to do on filing claims and seeing the value in the policy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Interestingly enough, when face to face goes down in the small business market in the U.S., yes, you see sales come down. You also see claims come down. Not as much in the way of claims are generated by these agents in there, educating everybody on the policy and asking very simple questions. Did anything happen to the family, you, your spouse, did you go to the doctor and you're eligible for a wellness benefit?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All of those issues lag, if you will, when there's not that face to face interaction, and what you had is many small businesses that were not allowing agents rightfully so into the work site, sometimes allowing for a virtual method of enrolment through zoom, or what have you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But interestingly, the agents I talked to, they would tell, would tell me, this is not particularly scientific, but generally what I would gather is their close rate on a zoom call would be about half that of meeting face to face. And that doesn't really seem to surprise anybody on the surface when you think about it, but it's meaningful when you talk about the effectiveness of an agent selling on commission only and needing to do the job.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So that fortunately in the U.S. is recovering more quickly, more quickly than Japan. It's opening up more. You're seeing more of that activity and you're seeing it in our numbers with sales trajectory, improving quite a bit quarter to quarter to quarter. I think we're now operating at 85% of pre pandemic levels which is very good. And I think it's improving from here. I would say, then there are the three new businesses, and these are the real deltas in our business model.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And by three new businesses, I mean the true group life and disability that we acquired from Zurich; we're very pleased with that business. We're particularly pleased with the quality of that business. They had the benefit of starting from scratch. Most of these true group life and disability platforms that are out there of much larger players with much more scale; also have a lot of legacy systems they have to work through. And those legacy systems make it more difficult on the expense ratio, but they also make it more difficult in data and analytics supplied to the employer, particularly around leave management.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So Zurich did the right thing at the time. They started from scratch with a bunch of experienced people and they built it the way it should be built. We stepped in mid build, bought that property, and we're continuing the build under the Aflac umbrella. And so what we're particularly proud of is that it's got good products, but the products are fairly generic across the industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The big difference maker is, do you know how to do leave management? Can you do it well? Best example of that is the state of Connecticut that awarded us their paid family, medical leave administration business for the entire state of Connecticut and all eligible citizens in Connecticut. That's a testimony to being good enough at and dynamic enough at that to be able to award be awarded a contract like that our network dental and vision business is growing.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's growing slowly because before pandemic, we made the conscious decision to introduce network dental and vision in the small business market first, because that's a very needed product in that market to benefits from halo effect. If we can sell network and dental and vision to a company that reaches 60% of their employees, that helps the sale of our volunteer product, where on average, we tend to only sell to about 15, to maybe 20% of the employees in a given business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So that halo effect allowed us to really justify the position and really grow it organically. But it started in small business just in time to be hit by COVID. So that'll pop up as small business recovers and our small business franchise recovers, and then direct to consumer we've always been in it, but we wrapped a bow around it, put more science around it, putting more systems in it, design products, especially for it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And basically that's a leveraging of our brand. We're just leveraging our brand, our brand awareness. We do about $30 million to $40 million a year of direct to consumer by accident. People see our ads on Saturday morning football or whatever the case may be. And they try to contact us and they call one 800 number. And we process that we decided a few years back, no, let's make this an outright fundamental business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Do I grow it and have a real digital answer in the marketplace? And so we're, we're happy with it. All of those together, those three businesses have gone from 5% of our sales in the first quarter of this year to 13% of our sales in the third quarter. So we've gone through the acquisition integration launch mode, and we're now into the benefit realization mode and expected good things from those big.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So maybe we can move on to the accounting changes coming in 2023. I think you, you all have provided more disclosures than most companies thus far. So I'd just be interested to hear maybe if you could just take us through some of the more impacted areas and how you, how you view the accounting changes versus the actual economic impacts?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Max Brodén</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, Absolutely. So accounting has gotten really exciting all of a sudden. So in our most recent queue, we announced that the LDTI adoption upon implementation, which is the implement, is next year, but the adoption date was actually December 31st of last year. So at that time we expect to record an $18 billion to $20 billion adjustment to our, a OCI which obviously will impact our total shareholders’ equity. But obviously more importantly the ex a OCI shareholders equity will not be impacted by, by this adoption.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So why is it such a big impact? It all leads back to a big, big block of business in Japan and predominantly our cancer block, which is a very long duration generally more than 20 years. And when you have such long duration of policies that were in a long time ago in a much, much higher interest rate environment and we locked those rates in when those policies were written under five 60, we now are resetting those rates.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So the negative investment margin that we have earned over time gets accelerated in upon the adoption date through a OCI. But what we also now is that we have had a very favourable morbidity experience. So the morbidity margin over time has been significantly larger than the negative investment margin, but what we're not doing is that we're not accelerating in the very favourable morbidity margin. If we were to do that is [indiscernible], would've allowed us to do that. We would have had actually a very favourable ACI component instead of a very negative.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So all this being said, what does it actually lead to well on a next ACI basis? No change obviously on a total shareholder's equity and 18 to 20 bill dollar decline in shareholders equity when you then turn to economics and cash flows, there's actually no change. So no change to our capital levels capital ratios, either in Japan or the us, no change to our FSA earnings, which drives dividends out of, in Japan, no change to our statutory earnings, which is driving dividends out of our U.S. entities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And most importantly of all is that we are not changing the way we view evaluate, manage the company product or how we manage capital within the, the firm as well, so all that being said, the $18 billion to $20 billion is an eye popping number, but it's a non-economic number and it doesn't lead to any change or view that we have in the way we either manage the company or view the value of our business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I said I open it up if does anybody have a question in the audience? All right. So maybe, maybe I'll ask the question about your ESG efforts. I know Aflac has done a lot there, so maybe if you could take us through some of that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, I think like most companies that, that appear at the conference here, folks are working really, really hard and have been for several years long before ESG to be a good corporate citizen.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And for quite Frank governance has been front and center for everybody for quite a while. I, I think where we're focused right now on ESG is real, tangible, measurable advancements that we can't put forward as objectives, tie it to incentive comp, meet those objectives and report on those objective. And so be very tangible about it because I think, I think the world, as well as investors are probably getting a little bit wary of the constant drumbeat of the storyline, if you will, of ESG. And they just want to know why, why it matters and what you're doing.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So what we did when we sat down this year, are going into ESG, as we said, look, let's, let's set five basic objectives. So number one, let's advance the ball on our investment practices to be ESG ready with all of the screens in place. We capped that off with a tangible move and announcement a couple weeks ago where we are officially a [indiscernible] principles are responsible investing signator. This is becoming more important in the us, but I can tell you it's exceptionally important in Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so being a PR, I signatory commit to you to advancing the ball in very stringent guidelines of how you invest your capital. The second is we want to issue a sustained ability bond. We did that. We issued a 400 million sustainability bond put that money to work and that was a real milestone because in order to issue a sustainability bond, you can't get there unless the audited practices of how you use the money and invest the money square with the requirements to be designated as sustainability bond.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So a real tangible thing on diversity and inclusion, we want to hit 23% women in officer positions in Japan. And we're on track to do that. We have a long range target of 30% women in officer positions is a major, major effort in Japan as a corporate dynamic. It is really their diversity initiative. It's got eco economic implications to Japan, as well as cultural implications were on pace to do that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We committed to put 600 million to work for diversity inclusion investments, social good investments out of our general account. And we have committed to doing that, that included a, a sound point investment that we made and at equity ownership that is designated towards opportunity zones, investing in transitional real estate, located in opportunity zones, where we can make good money on those investments. It fits into our portfolio guidelines our loan guidelines, and yet still advances the ball in a tangible way.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And last but not least the reporting. And so issuing a, a sustainability report through TCFD advancing that ball. I would say what capped that off is we, we learned a couple weeks ago that we were added to the Dow Jones, industrial sustainability index which we think is meaningful and its important recognition. So what we're trying to do is say, look, we have a great story. Many companies have a great story. We have an incredibly diverse board and executive team. We have we have sent $130 million of donation to the Aflac cancer centre and have one of the leading platforms leading cancer and children with cancer and blood disorder.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have done a lot of good things as a company, but what we want to do is be very, very specific, very targeted goals embedded in incentive comp. So that if we do what we say, we're going to do you see incentive comp bump up 5% if we don't achieve everything. Okay. And it's a zero tolerance, you have to achieve everything. Okay. It's either flat comp or down 5%. Okay. So put it in your incentive comp as well. And that's the way we've approached ESG. And that's the way we're going to continue to approach it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Alexander Blostein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, thank you for joining us.
