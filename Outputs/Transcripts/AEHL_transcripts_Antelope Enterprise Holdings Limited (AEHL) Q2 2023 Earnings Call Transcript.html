My communications colleague, [Lynn Burstein] (ph), will be translating for CEO, Will Zhang. Mr. Zhang, you may proceed.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Will Zhang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Interpreted] Thank you, David. On behalf of the company, I would like to welcome everyone to our first half 2023 earnings conference call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I am extremely proud of the achievements of our Kylin Cloud team as our first half revenue is up 172.5% as compared to the same period last year. Our revenue for our livestreaming ecommerce business came in at $44.2 million for the six months, modestly higher than our top line pre-announcement. Further, if not for certain non-cash expenses, we would have recorded positive operating income for our livestreaming ecommerce segment for the period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a first mover in the livestreaming ecommerce space in China, Kylin Cloud provides turnkey livestreaming marketing and broadcasting services to consumer brand companies by matching consumer brand products with the appropriate hosts and influencers. We believe that Kylin Cloud has the core competencies to increase its market share in the periods ahead in what we believe is an evolutionary sales channel and as we continue to engage as a pure play in the sector.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe that we have a tremendous market opportunity ahead of us and are confident that Kylin Cloud's unique approach will continue to redefine the ecommerce livestreaming landscape. I am genuinely excited about our value proposition for our customers, and I'm confident that we will create value for our shareholders as well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would like to turn over the call to the company's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Edmund Hen, who will discuss the company's first half earnings results in more detail. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Edmund Hen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Mr. Zhang.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I will now move on to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the six-month ending June 30, 2023.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Revenue for the six-month ended June 30, 2023 was RMB309.3 million, or US$44.6 million, a 161.5% increase from our RMB118.2 million, or US$18.3 million, for the same period of 2022. The increase in revenue was due to RMB305.9 million, or US$44.2 million, in revenue generated from our livestreaming ecommerce business, a 172.5% increase from RMB112.3 million, or US$17.3 million, for the same period of 2022. Our livestreaming ecommerce business constitute 99% of first half 2023 total revenue as compared to 83% for the same period of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross profit for the six-month ended June 30, 2023 was RMB47.2 million, or US$6.8 million, as compared to RMB1.9 million, or US$0.3 million, for the same period of 2022. The increase in gross profit was due to RMB52 million, or US$7.5 million, in gross profit generated from our livestreaming ecommerce business, a 1,591.4% increase from RMB3.1 million, or US$0.5 million, for the same period of 2022. For the first half of 2023, our gross profit margin was 17% for the livestreaming ecommerce business as compared to gross profit margin of 2.7% for the first half of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Other income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was RMB2.8 million, or US$0.4 million, as compared to RMB1.7 million, or US$0.3 million, for the same period of 2022. For the first half of 2023, we had RMB0.5 million in interest income, income of RMB1.2 million attributable to forgiveness of a loan by an affiliate of a shareholder of the company, a government grant of RMB0.3 million and other income of RMB0.8 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Selling and distribution expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were RMB49.2 million, or US$7.1 million, as compared to RMB1.9 million, or US$0.3 million, for the same period of 2022. The increase in sales and distribution expenses was primarily due to an increase in travel expenses of RMB0.1 million, an increase in commission expenses of RMB2.6 million, and an increase in advertising and promotion expenses of RMB44.6 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were RMB38.7 million, or US$5.6 million, as compared to RMB6.4 million, or US$1 million, for the same period of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss from continuing operations before taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2023 for our livestreaming business was RMB73,000 for the first half of 2023, as compared to an income from continuing operations before taxes of RMB7.4 million, or US$1.1 million, for the first half of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss per basic share and fully diluted share from the continuing operation for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were RMB23.44, or US$3.40, as compared to loss per basic and fully diluted share of RMB5.14, and US$0.79, for the same period of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, we had a cash and bank balances of RMB3.1 million, or US$0.4 million, compared with RMB3.9 million, or US$0.6 million, as of December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, out total outstanding bank loan amounts were nil, and we had a notes payable of RMB9.3 million, or US$1.3 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As has been properly announced over the last two years, we enacted a corporate transformation to pivot towards high-growth technology areas, which included the acquisition of livestreaming ecommerce business. In December 2022, our Board of Directors unanimously agreed to divest its legacy ceramic tile building materials business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On December 30, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our legacy ceramic in exchange for a 5% unsecured promissory note with a principal amount of US$8.5 million. The note will mature in four years and the 5% and principal amount on the note is to be paid in four annual installments. A special meeting of the company's shareholders was held on February 21, 2023, where the shareholders approved for the sale of this business. And on April 28, 2023, the transaction closed.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving to our business outlook. We operate a livestreaming ecommerce business through our Kylin Cloud subsidiary, which comprises virtually all Antelope Enterprise ongoing business operations. The SaaS+ system platform strategically matches appropriate hosts and influencers to consumer brand products which results in increased sales for these companies. For the six months end June 30, 2023, Kylin Cloud generated 99% of the company's total revenue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Kylin Cloud provides a one-stop solution for consumer product companies to utilize the growing sales channel of livestreaming ecommerce since it heightens consumer engagement and can build brand loyalty through rich content and online interaction. We view ecommerce livestreaming as especially important since traditional ecommerce can be challenged in terms of its ability for brands to stand out and build personal connections with consumers. Kylin Cloud's social media hosts and influencers build trust with consumers which increase brand awareness and which drives product sales and increased margins.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the last few years, livestreaming ecommerce has comprised an ever-increasing percentage of China's ecommerce sales which we expect to continue in the years ahead, spurred by a customer ecosystem that includes a young demographic and their high usage rate of mobile devices. We believe that Kylin Cloud is unique in the livestreaming space since its utilization of advanced analytical -- analytics that matches hosts and influencers to consumer brand products which facilitates unique content for higher conversion rates as compared to traditional ecommerce. We believe that we will be able to capitalize upon this market opportunity in the periods ahead and will grow at a rate that is higher than ecommerce livestreaming sector.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary views and is based on information currently available to us, which are subject to change, and is subject to risks and uncertainties, as well as risks and uncertainties identified in the company's public filings.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this point, I would like to open up the call to any questions pertaining to our first half 2023 financial results.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi. I was curious, do you look at a certain metric for revenue for influencers? You guys always post the number of influencers you have in your company profile in the press releases. I was just curious if you look at any metrics for revenue, like average revenue that an influencer brings in, or how do you view the value of each influencer?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Excuse me, may I have your question rephrased? One, I understand is about -- your question is about related to revenue. Please rephrase your question for me so that will maybe make us easier to understand. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. You disclosed in all of your press releases the number of influencers you have. I was curious how you look at the value of each influencer? If it's revenue per influencer, or how you guys view that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, the influencer is actually the people registered in our SaaS system. So, the more the influencer, that means we have more potential to generate the future revenue. That means more people is helping our platform -- for our livestreaming business and more people will contribute to our livestreaming in our platform.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Right. I'm asking is there a certain metric you look at to see the value of each influencer? So, as you went from 300,000 to 400,000 in the current press releases, should we expect that revenue to keep increasing at a relatively similar rate going forward as you bring influencers on?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Because we -- our business, we still share very small market share in this livestreaming business. So, we're expecting more and more these influencers will join our platform, and so that -- and also the revenue will make -- the influencer will contribute in a significant amount to our revenue. And at this point, it's very difficult to calculate the metrics between the influencer and the revenue. But the thing is, the more influencers join our platform, we believe that the revenue will also goes up in a significant manner.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And you've had gross margin improvement. Do you expect to see that going forward? And is there kind of a number you're shooting for to reach, whether it's this year or in the next few years?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, you are correct. We're expecting the gross margin will -- goes up in the coming period and years. Also, as I mentioned, we are still in a very early stage in this livestreaming area and we believe that there's still a lot of room, a number of room to grow in our gross margin.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Is there any rough number you guys are targeting that you're aiming to reach for, or is it just flow increases?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this moment, as I mentioned, we're still at a very early stage. So, it is very difficult for us to estimate the mature gross margin in the future growth. But we believe that the current stage does not reflect the whole picture for the business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">William Gregozeski</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. All right. Great quarter.
