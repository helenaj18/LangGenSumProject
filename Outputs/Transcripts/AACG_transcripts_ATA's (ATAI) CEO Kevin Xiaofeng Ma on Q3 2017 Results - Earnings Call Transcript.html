The company’s Interim CFO, Ms. Shelly Jiang will provide an overall of operational and financial highlights for the third quarter 2017, beginning with Slide 4. The company’s Chairman and CEO, MR. Kevin Ma will then discuss ATA’s outlook and growth strategy for fiscal 2017, before opening the floor for questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I will turn the call over to ATA’s Interim CFO, Ms. Shelly Jiang. Please go ahead, Shelly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Shelly Jiang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you Sheila, and welcome everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our operational and financial highlights and then briefly provide an update on our outlook for fiscal year 2017.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I will begin on Slide 5, which lists some of our operating highlights for the third quarter. In the third quarter 2017, ATA delivered approximately 7 million billable exams, compared to 5.1 million in the same period of fiscal year 2016. This increase was driven by both public and private sector exams, as well as revenue contributions from the National Tax Adviser Occupational Qualification Exam or the CTA exam, which was previously held in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On October 15 and October 16, 2016, we successfully delivered the National Unified Certified Public Accountant or CPA exam to about 2.2 million tests. This marks the fifth consecutive year that ATA has provided our services for the CPA exam and is a prime example of our leading capability in simultaneous massive scale computer-based testing delivery across China.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On November 5, 2016, we also successfully delivered the National Tour Guide Qualification Examination for the first time across 32 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China on behalf of the China National Tourism Administration. For the Fund Practitioner Certification Exam, we doubled growth in revenue during the quarter compared to the previous year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving to Slide 6, which lists our financial highlights for the third quarter 2017, ATA reported net revenues of RMB273.5 million for the period, a 23.5% increase from RMB221.4 million in the prior year period. This was driven by increased exam volumes from both new and existing exams, such as, the Fund Practitioner Certification Exam, the CPA exam, the National Tour Guide Qualification Exam, and Qualification Exam for Housing and Urban-Rural Construction Field Professionals, and revenue contributions from the CTA exam held in third quarter 2017, which I just mentioned was held in fourth quarter 2016 in the prior fiscal year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross margin for third quarter 2017 was 50.8%, compared to 49.5% in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the change in revenue mix. The company also reported a 52.8% increase in net income attributable to ATA Inc. of RMB75.4 million, which compares to RMB49.4 million in the prior year period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Following a strong fiscal third quarter 2017, the company is reiterating its previously adjusted net revenues and non-GAAP net income attributable to ATA Inc. guidance range for fiscal year 2017, which I will discuss in further detail later on this call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the next slide, we breakout revenues for third quarter 2017 by our businesses, which can be divided into two areas: testing services and online education services. Testing services accounted for about 94% of revenues in third quarter 2017. We have seen strong growth in our testing services for both traditional sector and HR Select and the TOEIC.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On Slides 8 and 9, we provide a breakdown of the company’s financial results for third quarter 2017 and for the first nine months of 2017. As this information has been fully detailed in our earnings release, I won’t repeat the numbers here, but I’m happy to take any questions on this information during Q&amp;A.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving to Slide 10, we provide a supplemental chart of quarterly numbers adjusted for share based compensation expenses and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. Excluding this item, adjusted net income attributable to ATA Inc. for third quarter 2017 was RMB76.5 million or US$11million compared to RMB51.4 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per ADS attributable to ATA Inc. during third quarter 2017 on a non-GAAP basis were RMB3.34 compared to RMB2.24 in the prior-year period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to be supported by free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, which we’ve highlighted on Slide 11. As of December 31, 2016, ATA cash and cash equivalents were about US$35.7 million, working capital was US$29.8 million, shareholder’s equity was US$63.7 million compared to US$38.4 million, US$38.1 and US$61.1 million at March 31, 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As shown on Slide 12, we expect fourth quarter 2017 net revenues will be in the range of RMB26 million to RMB31million. As previously announced, we expect fiscal year 2017 net revenues to be between RMB455 million and RMB475 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to ATA Inc.’s guidance to be between RMB nil and RMB10 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company is exploring growth opportunities in the K-12 education assessment and recruitment sectors during fiscal year 2017. In January 2017, the company successfully delivered the first formal services to the Tianjin Nankai Education Bureau. Kevin will provide more details in this regarding just a moment. Please keep in mind that this guidance is just on our own internal projections and we will continue to evaluate our projections on volume basis.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I’d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Kevin Ma, to provide some more details on our growth strategy and outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Kevin Xiaofeng Ma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Shelly, and welcome, everyone. ATA achieved record results during the third quarter as we continued to maintain strong operations and the push for the new business development efforts that we believe we will result in ongoing [indiscernible] to fiscal year 2017.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Expected a solid growth from government institutions, which Shelly mentioned, we also continued to see steady growth from our corporate clients. As our cooperation with large enterprise has grown as these clients increasingly rely on our quality services and the excellent reputation to data support their recruitment, internal recruiting and selection process.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During third quarter 2017, we saw double-digit increase in revenue from the private sector, we continue to provide testing service to globally recognized companies, institutions and organizations, such as Huawei, China PEC, China Mobile and a number of commercial banks, including Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank and so on.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to actively pursue potential new business leads, including organizations that are prime candidates for converting paper-based exam to computer-based exams, so those are ongoing efforts. We have expanded our business by streaming cooperation with existing clients, while also welcoming new clients through our marketing initiatives and referrals. We are confident in the growth potential of our traditional testing service business as we see continued demand for our service across various industries.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">While we work to further expand testing service into other professions, ATA also continues to explore growth opportunities in education, such as K-12 and higher education and corporate recruitment sectors by leveraging our core competence in advanced psychometric knowledge and testing technologies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the first week of January 2017, ATA was authorized by the Tianjin Nankai Education Bureau to execute its first formal education assessment for Grade 7 and Grade 10 students in the Nankai District of Tianjin, which carried about 7,000 students. This marks our first step in K-12 education assessment in public schools in China and our team continues to communicate with all levels of education services and institutions in different regions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In past years, ATA Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary ATA Online has made several strategic investments in a number of innovative education companies. Those investments have targeted different areas, including online English language education. The International studies market, service of academic solution and resources for higher education community.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Online virtual custom platform provider and provider of data analytics and the HR recruitment process by SAAS. All of these investments are in line with our growth catalyst in the education and recruitment sectors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to have a positive outlook on fiscal year 2017. We continue to grow our testing service business while further developing new business sectors, such as online education and the K-12 education assessment. We are dedicated to providing high-quality service to clients, while remaining observant of market trends, which is key to staying on top of opportunities related to our core business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, operator, let’s open it for questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Peter Halesworth of Heng Ren. Please go ahead, Peter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you and greetings management. Thank you for your results and shows some promise for the future. I just wanted to ask regarding Kevin’s comments regarding the mix of customers with an increasing number of what he said were larger enterprises, or corporates from the private sector bringing double-digit growth. Could you put an exact number on that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then secondly, related to that, could you also give us some sense of what I would assume would be better profitability from these types of customers either on a per client basis, is there something that’s – now it gets to an ARPU, or is there a gross margin that would show that the private sector mix is more profitable than either the state sector or the exams for the big association, some color on that would be helpful? That’s my first question. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, thank you, Peter. Regarding the first question, we have the double-digit growth in the private sector. And the private sector’s total revenue is around 20% of the total revenues in Q3. And the revenue from the new customers, we need to now have the exam, the exact figures. But for the top five new customers, which generated revenues in Q3 is around RMB10 million. So I hope that will help you to understand.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Regarding the second question, the gross margin generated from the private sector is a little bit higher than the government sector, but similar. That means their gross margin is around 50% not only in the Q3, but also for the whole year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. So just – so what is the private sector mix this increase in revenue, is it around the 50% gross margin? Is that correct?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, yes, exactly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then my second question is just related to the capital allocation and the stock. So although we’ve seen a bump up in revenues in the – this quarter, which is promising, we’ve just seen basically stagnation in revenue growth and margins over the past five years and significant rise in the cost of revenues by about 30% in the past five years, and the returns ROE – return on investment at around a very average 6%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I was wondering if there was any – because of the strong cash flow generation, has there been any thought given to instituting a regular dividend? This might help investors be more patient and stay invested in the stock if they have this incentive for a regular return. We’ve seen other U.S. listed Chinese companies do this and it has stabilized their stock price and your stock price is down about 45% of its high in 2015. So I’m wondering if there’s any consideration being given to a regular dividend?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Peter. The company is always considering to share the benefits with our shareholders, and we also have done the dividends in past years. So if we have the dividend plan, we will disclose it to the markets.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This should be under active consideration, because again, the stock has not performed well. And I think, investors would be more inclined to remain invested if they could see a fairly predictable and regular return from the stock. And I think, the company can easily provide that with its free cash flow generation. I think the last move in the stock was actually to that high point in 2015 was helped by the issuance of a dividend, which we’ve always seen won in the past seven years?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, Peter. We definitely consider the dividend and we will discuss on the long-term.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. I’ll go back in the queue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Peter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. And at this time, we have no more questions in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Okay, thank you. And the question comes from the line of Peter Halesworth again of Heng Ren. Please go ahead, Peter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. Well, I have the team on the line, just two quick questions. One is, what is the status of being listing of the ATA Online? And you if could give us an update on that please?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Regarding the private placement, we mentioned before, we haven’t finalized that up to now, and because we’re considering other options for better valuations. And since our business progresses well, and we believe we’re continuing to grow our business, the company’s valuation will increase, which also contribute to the interest of the shareholders eventually. So we are selecting our investors and from our valuation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then, is there any plans for a road show in the U.S.? We haven’t – I haven’t been informed of any road show recently. When was the last road show to the U.S. and when is the next one planned?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shelly Jiang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. We do have the plan, and it will be in the March, or the early April.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then lastly, and this is a question for more for Kevin, Shelly. Kevin, can you explain why Shelly is still the Interim CFO? Is that something by her own choice, or it just seems rather odd from a investor standpoint that someone to have an interim title for almost two years. And I’m wondering what is the situation if you could clear that up for us? Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Xiaofeng Ma</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Interpreted] Peter, thanks for your suggestion. We’re still discussing this internally. Thank you for your suggestion.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Peter Halesworth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No, it’s not a suggestion, Katherine, it’s a question if we can get an explanation of why there’s been an interim status for two years.
