Ms. Huang, you may proceed.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Meishuang Huang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Thank you, David. On behalf of the company, I would like to welcome everyone to our second half and fiscal year-end 2020 earnings conference call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the fiscal year 2020, we experienced challenging market additions as impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak had a material adverse impact on the demand for our products, with customers both having canceled and delayed their purchases awaiting the normalization of business activities. We instituted a 15% price decrease in late 2019 in order to sustain our sales volume as well as retain customers for future business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This mitigated what we believe would've been a greater decline in sales as compared to the modest decrease in sales volume that occurred in the second half of the year as business conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic began to normalize.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For fiscal year 2020, we utilized production facilities capable of producing 4.2 million square meters of ceramic tiles per year out of the company's effective total annual production capacity of 51.6 million square meters of ceramic tiles. Consistent with our practice in past periods, we maintained a reduced utilization of existing plant capacity based on the current market environment to keep our operating costs low. We intend to bring additional capacity online as the business environment improves.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We remain focused on diversifying our operations to fuel our growth. While we remain committed to our core business, our 2 subsidiaries, Chengdu Future, which provides computer consulting, and Antelope Chengdu, which developed fintech software, generated RMB 7.2 million or USD 1.1 million in income in 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">China's real estate market has been resilient in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. And in the long term, we believe that the building materials sector will grow due to urbanization, innovative property development and upgrading of neglected housing stock. Further, we plan upon securing customers in the larger Southeast Asian market out of China to capitalize upon new building construction that is happening in this region's urban areas.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would like to turn over the call to the company's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Edmund Hen, who will discuss the company's second half 2020 earnings results in more detail. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Edmund Hen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, thank you, Ms. Huang. I will now turn -- I will now move on to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the 6 months ending December 31, 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our revenue for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 143.2 million or USD 21.1 million, a 4.6% decrease from RMB 150.2 million or USD 21.4 million for the same period of 2019. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was due to the 9.1% decrease in average selling price to RMB 21.8 or USD 3.34 for the second 6 months of 2020 versus the year ago period, which was offset by a 4.8% increase in sales volume as compared to the same period of 2019 to 6.6 million square meters for the second half of 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We instituted a 15% price decrease in late 2019 in order to sustain our sales volume as well as to retain customer for future business. Our average selling price decreased for the second half of 2020 as compared to the same period 2019 since the 15% price decrease was in effect for only 2 months in the latter period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Also, our sales volume grew sequentially from 1.8 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the first half of 2020 to 6.6 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the second half of 2020 as business conditions in China began to normalize.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross loss for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 26.9 million or USD 4 million compared to gross profits of RMB 66 million or USD 9.4 million for the same period of 2019. Taking into account is reversal of inventory impairments for 6 -- for both 6 months previous. The gross loss margin was 20.4% in the second half of 2020 as compared to a 6.2% gross profit margin for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Other income for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 12.2 million or USD 1.8 million as compared to RMB 7.5 million or USD 1.1 million for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Other income consists of rental income the company received by leasing out one of its production lines from its Hengdali facility pursuant to an 8-year lease contract. And the income contributions of RMB 7.2 million or USD 1.1 million from our newly incorporated subsidiaries, Chengdu Future and Antelope Chengdu, who are engaged in computer consulting and software development, respectively.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Selling and distribution expenses for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 4.2 million or USD 0.6 million. It slightly decreased RMB 5.6 million or USD 0.8 million for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Administrative expenses for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 11.9 million or USD 1.8 million as compared to RMB 9.2 million or USD 1.3 million for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due increase of start-ups and later expenses from our newly incorporated entities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Bad debt expenses for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 and have bad debt of RMB 48.5 million or USD 7.2 million as compared to bad debt expense of RMB 125.2 million or USD 17.8 million for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We recognized a loss allowance for an expected credit loss on financial assets, primarily on our trade receivables, which are subject to the impairment under International Financial Reporting Standards. We believe that we have undertaken appropriate measures to resolve the bad debt expense going forward. We will continue to review credit worthiness of each of our customers and continuously test our trade receivables balance in each upcoming fiscal period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 was RMB 81.6 million or USD 12 million as compared to a net profit loss of RMB 183.7 million or USD 26.1 million for the same period of 2019. The net loss primarily due to the gross loss and bad debt expense that was incurred during the period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss per basic and fully diluted share for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 were RMB 24.85 or USD 3.67 as compared to profit per basic and fully diluted share of RMB 92.01 or USD 13.08 for the same period of 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and bank balances of RMB 12.3 million or USD 1.9 million as compared to RMB 8.2 million or USD 1.2 million as of December 31, 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of December 31, 2020, our inventory turn was 242 days as compared to 194 days as of December 31, 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our trade receivables turnover, net of value-added tax, as of December 31, 2020, was 242 days compared to 194 days as of December 31, 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our trade payables turnover, net of value-added tax, was 22 days as of December 31, 2020 compared with 30 days as of December 31, 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of our plant utilization and CapEx, we utilized plant capacity capable of producing 1.5 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the 6 months ended December 31, 2020 and 4.2 million square meters of ceramic tiles for fiscal 2020 out of a total annual production capacity of 51.6 million square meters.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the 6 months ended December 31, 2020, we utilized the production capacity in our Hengda facility capable of producing 0.8 million square meters of ceramic tiles. And we utilized production capacity in our Hengdali facility capable of producing 0.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We reviewed the level of capital expenditures throughout the year and we made adjustments subject to market conditions. Although business conditions are subject to change, we anticipate a modest level of capital expenditure in 2021 other than those associated with minimal upgrades, small repairs and maintenance of equipments. Moving to our business outlook for fiscal year 2020. The company's operating results were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to pandemic, there was a national shutdown -- slowdown in production as a result of facility closure and the disruption in supply chains as well as travel restriction and related public health orders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This caused the China's GDP growth in 2020 to fall to 2.2%, the slowest rate in 4 decades. The COVID-19 pandemic results in high number of our customers' canceling or delaying their purchase awaiting the resumption of normal economic activity. However, our sales volume grew sequentially from 1.8 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the first half of 2020 to 6.6 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the second half of 2020 as business conditions in China began to normalize.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking forward, China's real estate market has been resilient in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sector continues to be important to China's economic growth as the sector and its impact on other business activity is estimated to comprise 25% of China's GDP. As the macroeconomic environment began to normalize in China, the central government has resumed the strategy of imposing measures to curb speculative behavior. This includes lending curbs, constraints on mortgage lending, higher down payments and restriction on the numbers of homes that families can buy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition, the Chinese government appears to be intent upon reducing debt in the highly leveraged property developer sector, which could stem land purchases and real estate developments. A new land policy authorized by central government and enacted by some municipality that is intended to improve transparency and prevent real estate speculation, also result in reducing new land sales.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We anticipate that this trend could potentially limit a new project development, which could make the business conditions for the construction and building materials sector challenging. We believe that the real estate and construction sector will continue to grow in the long term, which is of key importance to the building materials sector, and that urbanization continues to be a key driver for growth. The upgrading of neglected housing stock, innovative property development and the renovation of existing homes are additional factors, which could lead to higher demand for building materials.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We plan upon expanding our footprint domestically while also increasing our efforts to secure customers in the larger Southeast Asia market outside of China, and capitalize upon new building construction occurring in many of the region's urban area. We also remain focused on diversifying our operation to fuel our growth as we recently formed the 2 subsidiaries in the computer consulting and the fintech software development sector. While these new businesses contributed modestly to earnings in 2020, we anticipate further growth from these new ventures in the years ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary views and is based on the information currently available to us, which are subject to change and is subject to risks and uncertainties as well as risks and uncertainties identified in the company's public filings.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this point, I would like to open up the call to any questions pertaining to our second half 2020 financial results. Operator, please?</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>David Rudnick</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Very good.
