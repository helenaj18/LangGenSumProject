Good evening to those in America. I appreciate everyone's time. I'm pleased to be here today with Ruobai Sima, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Sima succeeded Amy Tung, who has decided to step down as CFO for personal reasons. Amy has been with ACG for over 15 years, serving various roles within finance and operations. She has played a key role in our development over these years, and we are grateful for her expertise as I say and mainly variable contributions over the years, but only do I concern is to [indiscernible] college or their friend. Amy will remain with ACG in advisor capacity over the next few quarters to ensure a smooth transition, and we appreciate our ongoing support.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Mr. Sima brings to ACG 70 years of experience in finance and accounting as well as strategic financial planning and execution at public and private companies in the financial, automotive and travel industries. We'll be way to doing ACG Mr. Sima as CFO at various automotive service campaigns. We are competing to that is expense -- expertise [impress] and accounting will be invaluable addition to our leadership.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I will turn it over to Sima to our first quarter highlights.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ruobai Sima</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And thank you, Kevin, and for the kind introduction instruction. And I'd like to begin by sharing [indiscernible] and to be joining ACG at the time in its history. While we are being pleased with some challenges and caused by the ongoing pandemic environment and increasing competition. ACG has a strong track record of delivering positive student outcomes, and it is a reputable institution in the creative arts education space.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we are well positioned to overcome the short-term hurdles, and I'm very grateful to have this opportunity and to be a part of ACG's incredible bright future. 2022 got off to a very good start. And we saw a modest increase in student enrollment. Although credit hours delivered remaining stable during the fourth quarter, and we were able to achieve a 12.1% increase in net revenues as well as notable year-over-year improvement in gross profit and margin.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution and from our portfolio training and overseas study counseling services as well as continued product shifts and from time-based programs and towards project-based programs. In addition, our research-based learning opportunities have been well received by students and continue to be in high demand.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a few of our core cities are continue to face pandemic-related lockdown restrictions, and we are shifted our deliver method to online where appropriate, offering students and greater flexibility and ongoing support despite not being able to take in-person classes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our core portfolio training program enrolled 537 students during the fourth quarter of 2022 and compared to 528 students in the prior year period. Enrollment tend to be an indicator and the future credit hours delivered, and we were placed that enrollments remaining stable year-over-year in parallel with resurgence of COVID-19 certain cities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered 27,494 credit hours for our portfolio training programs. Lower total credit hours remaining flat and we have continued to see an ongoing shift in our portfolio training and making favor of project-based programs versus realtime-based programs. And project-based programs or increased 23% and realtime-based programs decreased by 19%. Our continued effort to share the program is contributed to improve operational efficiencies and giving us the opportunity to grow revenue while improving gross margin.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have also continued to explore ways in which it ACG can better serve a great population of students from diverse backgrounds. We have received a positive feedback from the students and who are attending our International Arts Foundation Program centered in Beijing and Shuren-ACG Arts Center, both of which opened their doors in September 2021. In order to help students with diverse needs to pursue their further study goals in creative arts.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And with that, let's move to financials and for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 12.1% and to RMB 42.1 million and from RMB 37.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by an increase in service delivered for portfolio training and overseas study counselling. Portfolio training services and were delivered either important through ACG's nation-wide training center network or were online platform, which represented around 63.3% of total net revenue during the period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross margin improved to 45.7% during the 2022 first quarter, up from 39.6% in the prior year period. The improvement was primarily driven by various paths the increased proportion of revenues from portfolio training and overseas study counselling services. And improve our operating efficiencies and from ongoing shape of ACG's portfolio training program and mix towards project-based programs and related cost of optimization efforts.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss attributable to ACG improved to RMB 15.9 million and during the first quarter of 2022 and compared to RMB 19 million in the prior year period. And moving to the balance sheet, and we continue to be a solid financial position and raised USD 9.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital deficit was USD 32.3 million, and total shareholders' equity was USD 27.6 million at March 31, 2022, compared to working capital deficit of USD 30.2 million and shareholders' equity of [USD 3 million], respectively, and at December 31, 2021. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, and he will depend upon our outlook and growth traffic. Kevin?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Kevin Ma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Sima. We were pleased with the stable performance delivered in the first quarter of 2022. During the period, China experienced post loan related to local COVID-19 transmission in a few of our key cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen and Suzhou, which also led to certain travel restrictions across the country. The situation has since worsened with the mandatory lockdown, taking place in major cities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Some of our learning centers have had to close and cease in person's instruction, while we are still reinforcing service to our students in the cities where our campus has remained open. We are providing online class delivery option for students impacted by lockdowns in certain cities. In the short term, this may have an impact on business, there will always be students who prefer in-person instruction. However, we believe we will acted to overcome the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The majority of our students are determined to continue pursuing their studies in the [peso divested], and we are [indiscernible] support them to the best of our business. As Sima noted earlier, our research-based learning service, which tend to be good program that provides the project-based and learning experience remain quite popular. They originate the [indiscernible] to the pandemic, which drove more set to each of the students in terms of learning objectives to delivery forms and clear the project time.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are pleased to see a growing sentiment of online research-based learning programs in 2020 and are excited about it through growth potential beyond the post pandemic era. We are extremely proud of our students and intend to continue investing in our business and it's finishing partnership within the industry, which will serve as a foundation for our first future growth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe we are well positioned to grow our business with the current portfolio of program offerings as more countries began to ease travel restrictions. We believe that research-based learning and overseas counselling services business will be able to reach their full potential. While we are mindful of the -- there's computation within the -- remains our focus on serving our students and achieving their evolving needs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us in '22 and look forward to maintaining our leading position in creative arts education as we continue to drive positive outcomes for our students.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I'd now like to hand the floor over to Jun Zhang, ACG's President to provide an update on our current growth initiatives. Jun will make his mark in Mandarin which will be followed by English translation. Jun, please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jun Zhang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Kevin. Since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020, we have work to continue developing our online platform. We need to be nimble and flexible, the need to have a technologically [indiscernible] Delivery methods for our courses became absolutely clear when the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19 affected people all over the world over 2 years ago.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have continued to develop resources into quickly reacting to COVID-related [influxes] on our operations. And have remained focused on providing the best quality education services for our students, even when some of our campuses are temporarily closed due to local resurgence.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">ACG has continued to develop additional short-term programs, both online and in person where feasible, including online book camps, internships, domestic travel and certain team research-based learning programs. For example, during the first quarter, we organized an environmental protection culture and creative design camp at Xidao in Sanya, an island in Hainan province, offering a unique experience for over 20 students who are able to create recycling marine products and learn from local artist.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The students have the opportunity to work on individual and group RPs and projects, and some of their work was selected into the exhibitions at the [indiscernible] protection center. This program was well received by the participating students. We believe the public health situation in China may improve over the next several weeks and remain optimistic about the remainder of 2022 as the situations pain and more cities -- major cities can resume some level of normalcy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to plan for short-term summer camps and team travels in the coming summer.

ACG's mission is to provide quality learning experiences that cultivate and enhance students' creativity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're confident in our ability to maintain our competitive advantages and leading position in the creative arts education market in China.
