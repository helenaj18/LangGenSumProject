Welcome to AAON, Incorporated First Quarter Sales and Earnings Review. There will be a question-and-answer period after management's brief presentation. The call will last approximately 45 minutes. I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Asbjornson. Please go ahead, Mr. Asbjornson.</p> <p><strong>Norman Asbjornson </strong></p> <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Before going forward, I'd like to read a forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p> <p>As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p> <p>I'd like now to introduce Scott Asbjornson, our CFO.</p> <p><strong>Scott Asbjornson</strong></p> <p>Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the three months ended March 31, 2015 to March 31, 2014. Net sales were up 0.5% to $76.8 million from $76.4 million. The increase in net sales was the result of the increase of number of units sold offset by a decrease in the average price unit as compared to 2014.</p> <p class="iW_EQ">Our gross profit percentage decreased 0.2%. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 28.4% in the<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> quarter just ended compared to 28.6% in 2014.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% to $8.3 million from $7.6 million in 2014. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A increased to 10.8% of total sales in the quarter just ended from 10.0% in 2014 primarily due to additional sales tax payments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Income from operations decreased 5.4% to $13.5 million or 17.6% of sales from $14.2 million or 18.6% of sales.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our effective tax rate increased to 37.5% from 31.3%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was unusually low due to a change in method of accounting for state investment credits. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 to be approximately 37.0%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net income decreased 14.5% to $8.4 million -- 10.9% of sales from $9.8 million or 12.9% of sales. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 16.7% to $0.15 per share from $0.18 per share.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Diluted earnings per -- were based on 54,640,000 shares versus 55,613,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this time, Iâ€™ll turn it over to our Chief Accounting Officer, Rebecca Thompson.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Rebecca Thompson</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Scott. Looking at the balance sheet you will see that we had a working capital balance of $98 million versus $88.4 million at December 31, 2014. Cash and investments totalled $49.2 million at March 31, 2015. The investments have maturities ranging from 1 month to 16 months.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our current ratio is approximately 3.5:1. Our capital expenditures were approximately $16 [ph] for the quarter. We expect our CapEx for the year to be $22 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Shareholders' equity per diluted share is $3.33 at March 31, 2015, compared to $3.14 at December 31, 2014. We continue to remain debt free.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I'll now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Norman Asbjornson</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Net sales were up 0.5% for the quarter. The sales increased due to unit sales not size of units. Unit sales not in line with expectations, all expectations we had indicated we will have more growth than what we experienced. Our slowdown in growth as far as we can determine was connected in the Northeast and upper Midwest to weather conditions which existed [ph] in first quarter that were unusually harsh.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The other portion of effect due to the economy was we have a strong economic basis in the energy states which were negatively affected by a drop in oil prices. These two areas account for an excess of 50% of our normal sales.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We also have had a problem with some slowdown in some segments of orders. We had a slowdown in many factories and though manufacturing had a good starting condition and they were not releasing the orders for the air conditioning as fast as we had thought.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The general nature of the market in there is still looking very bright, itâ€™s just that it just didnâ€™t happen in the first quarter like we thought it should. We have seen some upswing at the very end of the first quarter as was noted by the fact that we increased our backlog from yoy, and therefore we didnâ€™t get it off the door because the increase in orders only started during March and that was not possible to be shipped during the quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We just picked the first, second, third quarter to still be strong and a little stronger than last year but possibly noticed as strong as it looked like earlier in the year. The various markets that we are seeing, the commercial and retail are appearing to be very solid and appear to be growing. The other one that is growing pretty well is the office market, and office market seems to be coming back pretty strongly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The [Indiscernible] that are kind of more than the -- down still are healthcare, educational and religious, so itâ€™s kind of a mixed bag in the commercial market. The reports I just indicated from what census bureau says is happening in the building industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It would be our expectation that we will be more in tune with what our forecast was a year ago with what our thoughts were a year ago at the beginning of this year as opposed to what happened to us in the first quarter. We think that was somewhat an abnormality and therefore itâ€™sâ€™ not indicative of our ongoing presence.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The other thing that we are already going forward is that our operations have gotten to be very much better than they have been anytime in the past and our problem has more moved over into getting orders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the past, getting orders was really kind of secondary to our problems because we had more internal problems than we did have getting orders problems. That has changed. Now our challenge is getting orders and we have the excess capacity and we are running very well internally.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so in that light, at the beginning of this year we determined that we made sure they have to put more emphasis on our sales efforts. Therefore we hired, we had four regional managers going into the year. We hired in January two additional ones and in March we hired third additional ones which basically increased our prices with our sales force by 75%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">These people werenâ€™t going to be immediately effective, but we have the individuals that we have great confidence in and so we expect as time goes on and you will certainly have a major impact on our ability to get orders, handle -- customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, how long will that take? Itâ€™s already begun to show and the order -- so our production is you know about 8 weeks later so we will start putting it on the bottom line in the second quarter but it will probably in the trailing end of the second quarter when these people detected [Indiscernible].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That does say to us of course that there is possibility that our third and fourth quarter are going to be even stronger than what we anticipate. So we think we made major improvements in our ability to get orders and our ability to handle orders â€“ excellent. So weâ€™re optimistic going forward that if economy doesnâ€™t show any significant hick up status we should do well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Conrad [ph] youâ€™ll want to come on now with questions and answers.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator Instructions].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Your first question comes from the line of Jon Braatz from Kansas City Capital. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jon Braatz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good afternoon, Norm.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good afternoon, Jon.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jon Braatz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Regarding the new sales efforts are those three gentlemen, are they moving AAON in to a different and a new geographical territory that maybe the dealers are unfamiliar with AAON or you penetrating existing markets?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Existing markets, what as we have the market place sliced up into four pieces before and in order to really be responsive to the customers and to our sales representatives much more effectively we needed more heads, more people talked into them and thatâ€™s why we went up.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We could have gone up marginally by dividing it down to 5 or 6, but we decided that our position internally was good enough that there wasnâ€™t anything they could do as far as getting enough orders for us to overwhelm us internally, so we basically went on upto 7 to see if we could really impact the market place in a big way with additional personnel managing fewer sales offices, managing the more tightly and be more responsive to the questions and the help that they could give. Itâ€™s just putting more bodies doing the same thing with the same group of people.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jon Braatz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now in what part of the country I suppose I should know this but what part of the country are you sort of the weakest at, and weakest and would you consider sort of a new entry into that area?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good question. Our weakest area in the country historically has been the West coast and the reason why that as I said earlier the problems werenâ€™t so much getting orders, our problems were getting the orders shipped. And now that we are over that, we can go ahead and try and get as many orders as we could. We were handling the west coast, did a tremendous job, coming out of the coast and going out there not all that often.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The individual we hired lives out in Bay area and is has been person out there in the market place for many years and then you know regional managers shift position with other companies on the west coast so his familiarization of the market place is very good and he is very confident in his knowledge base of what we are doing he has to learn a little bit about us of course which is different then what he knew before but thatâ€™s a short study and so heâ€™ll do so a lot of West coast stores comes probably our biggest upside there because we probably neglected it the most of any.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next one we probably neglected was for no great reason that was a little weak and should have been versus Southeast, or strong ones were the mid section of the country and the Northeast that was our strong place. So from Texas, north and then going up into the new England states was historically and still is our strong area.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we put a person down in Florida which we have not done before one person went to Florida. That was internal to us and was working out of long view and we moved them to Florida. We also hired another person who lives in Eastern Pennsylvania to handle the Northeast. We were handling the Northeast [Indiscernible] also. And we hired an individual out of Minneapolis to handle the upper middle part of the country. So we greatly improved our capability of serving our customer base.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jon Braatz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">One last question, on the fourth quarter call you talked about the pace of orders and December, January being sort of modest the incoming orders and how would you compare the lets say the incoming order rates now relative to maybe where they were earlier on in the year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well they started weakening first in November somewhere back in that timeframe. Stayed weak through February, increased remarkably in March and then kind of hesitated again in April and now it look like they are speeding up again for the month of May.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we got a little bit of a upsurge in March, we didnâ€™t couldnâ€™t carry the upsurge through April and now we think we are possibly back in the upsurge in May. So, and for more everything will be told from the market place by the sales offices, it sounds pretty promising â€“ about half of the market sounds quite promising and part of it sounds kind of flat.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jon Braatz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. All right, Norm. Thank you very much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Your next question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo with Sidoti and Company. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, Norm and Scott.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, Joe.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Scott Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, Joe.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, first question is a follow-up on Jonâ€™s question regarding the hires in all of these different parts of the country. Just wondering could you talk about the timing of all these hires? When did you make them? And when do you anticipate to see some results from them?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Weâ€™ve decided to make it in the fall of last year -- made the decision and then we have to find people to be hired. And so it took us â€“ by the time we found people to be hired and actually got them hired and on board weâ€™ve move the person from our Longview office earlier in the fall moved them to Florida.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We got Germany and Eastern Pennsylvania and Minnesota hired who started in January and we did not find and hired a person on the West Coast until March. So, the decision made and about September, October last year to start strengthening our sales force and it took us that long to do it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Even though these people are experienced and very capable while I believe of doing what weâ€™re looking to have done. They do have an orientation just like anybody new to his job. They have to learn about us. They have to learn about the people who are working with and several things like that. Itâ€™s my expectation that they are some doing some down force [ph] almost really when they came on. However, giving value at that level is really doing a lot of preliminary work that has to be done deploying orders actually materialized and deploying them and ship. So as I said most of the â€“ they are just starting to have a real effect on the shipments live at the present time as they are beginning to be effected by the two individuals weâ€™ve hired than the one we sent to Florida.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now the one in the West Coast really is just starting to going as far as some effect on the order. So by the time we put it to the bottom-line itâ€™s going to be late in the second quarter before we reach this bottom line very much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. So it sounds like maybe by the second half youâ€™ll have a â€“ second half of they year youâ€™ll have a good idea and progress of these hires and how theyâ€™re doing?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No, question. Weâ€™ve done a lot thing. We provide new monitory to all of the sales force and move that I the past. We were doing monthly reports to the regional managers. We now do weekly reports to the regional manager. So, we have a much more active and timely analysis, basically weâ€™ll analyze this whatâ€™s going on a weekly basis right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then second question regarding gross margin, the 30% gross margins that you put up last year. I was wondering if could just address that generally your thoughts on that sort of bar for this year. Can you surpass that or how you think about that an if you could just talk about the puts and takes driving the gross margins specifically pricing product mix and raw materials and how that affect it. How you anticipate those to drive however youâ€™re looking at gross margin this year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our industry I think you could say, delicate [ph] to get price increase and the cost structures and all things related [Indiscernible] and so we have not have price increase for two years, but at the same time weâ€™ve had the down swing which have offset it. Weâ€™ve had an improvements inefficiency which has offset. However, we had solid increases which have gone the other way.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it just kind of mix bag as to where itâ€™s going right now. I donâ€™t see at the present time any major cost increases occurring in the near terms because so much of the market and so much of the commodity is based on whatâ€™s happening on the worldwide basis and thereâ€™s a lot of softness and lot of in the pricing world, so copper, steel, aluminum which are the basic commodities donâ€™t seem to be going any place, so we up or down significantly as far as we can see at this time, although we have said one up here recently in copper. So, that is going up.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The labor situation is likely read on the national scale, sales is moving up about 2%, maybe they going to go up a little more than that this year, but weâ€™re not running up very fast, so the forces that were justifies price increase to start there. So weâ€™re probably going to be much like we are now. The only -- the two things that weâ€™re doing that will have significant effect, we are doing a significantly amount of revaluating sheet metal in our product and by that I mean you can always do thing smarter than you did them before and we have a process going on right now of evaluating the way we are doing of our sheet metal throughout the company and its making a major change and how much effort we have to go put into manufacturing sheet metal. So it will have positive effect on these two.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And when will that, have that already started to benefit or is that later this year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It is in process now as we get some of it done. Weâ€™re implementing it and weâ€™re implementing as we speak and we will be probably for pretty well through the third quarter and at the first point the figure will be pretty done with that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. So, the benefit is most likely third or fourth quarter?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Basically itâ€™s going to benefit us a little in the second but weâ€™ll have in third and fourth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">How significant is that going to be, is that going to be a needle mover for gross margin?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It will be probably move, but its not going to move with great deal, but it will move it little bit.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then I guess one of the other aspect of gross margin, I guess lot of the variable seem to be sort of stagnant pricing raw materials, labor costs, how about product mix, do you anticipate any favorable or unfavorable shift in product mix this year compared to last year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We donâ€™t see any coming on. We are doing a few things with new products which are going to possibly have an effect, but itâ€™s going to happen late in the year. The things that weâ€™re doing will bring in horizontal. We havenâ€™t basically had much kind on horizontal discharges, postal vertical discharge lift up and weâ€™re bringing in some horizontal rooftops which will in the third quarter be introduced in the third quarter will have a effect on the fourth quarter and going forward.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Weâ€™re making some â€“ we want to make some changes in repurchase of circuitry that likewise will start affecting us a little bit and our energy efficiency in the third quarter and going forward in the fourth quarter. So, those things are clear right now. That will probably also give us a little price reduction, but it will be just a small amount, so it wonâ€™t be a great amount.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. In regard to SG&amp;A cost I mean, as a percent of sales those increase year-over-year. I imagine some of that or most of it maybe more related to the additional sales and personnel that you brought on? Do you anticipate in the next quarter to possibly that would be sort of a headwind because of those additional costs but then later on as you get the benefits from the additional sales hopefully that youâ€™re going to drive that SG&amp;A is a percent of sales will turn down again is that youâ€™re looking at?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Scott Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This is Scott. SG&amp;A for the quarter was mostly driven by the additional sales tax payment that was a biggest differential in the quarter-versus-quarter issue. We were going through doing some internal audits and weâ€™re making some corrective payments, sales tax front. And so we have that come up and some of that money potentially could come back in future quarters as we pursue collections effects with our customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And how much is that in the quarter?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Scott Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That was about 600,000.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And that something that your â€“ that will sort of one time in nature or youâ€™re not totally serve?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Scott Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe we still have some more to clean up, take us through to possibly the third quarter to finish. But from here going forward we will also have offsetting collections from these customers that we anticipate being able to either proved they had already paid the taxes within their state or that they will then remit those taxes back to us.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then just lastly Norm, one of your largest markets and another market that you do serve education and healthcare, those are certainly soft market you pointed out in your prepared commentary, any signs of when these markets start to recover at all?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I havenâ€™t seen the sign of the [Indiscernible] they seem to be pretty stable and not deteriorating greatly, but they do seem to be getting modestly software. And I donâ€™t see anything telling me that they are going to turnaround. Thereâ€™s a lot of â€“ of there being a double metal, I think thereâ€™s a lot of going on relative to taxes and things of that nature that are affecting it too. They look like fish [ph] tied here to me.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joe Mondillo</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with DA Davidson. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thielman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, good afternoon.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good afternoon Brent.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thielman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Norm, the volatility in orders that you see in month-to-month here over the last several months, is that specific to the manufacturing sector of the Dolby market or is it across the board in the terms of the sectors you serve?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, the manufacturing market has done a better come back than any other market since 2008. And so it is a little stronger, itâ€™s kind of like I mentioned, however. the commercial market, the office market and that portion of the business has also started to show some strength, but being to some degree offset. The biggest market we have is the education market which is kind of stagnant.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, weâ€™re seeing a slight amount of upward movement in markets, but they are very hesitant to give out worst, in another words theyâ€™ve start building, the buildings donâ€™t â€“ the people duly design work, they pay for the design work at the architecture level and its shows up in all the indexes youâ€™ll see there that there is upward swing in it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Then they terribly from all we can determined, some of them at least get hesitant about going to the contract place and actually contracting to build the buildings. And then after the contractors get it, there doesnâ€™t seem to be great need to get the building done quickly or something, in other words they move along a little more slowly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This I think is kind of reflected and the fact that the cost side increasing and so consequently the builders if theyâ€™re not pushed are going to do the way that they know how to best maximize their powerful ability which is using the better people and not doing a lot of over [audio gap] and actually are sort of inefficient. So they were to be efficient and thereâ€™s no inflation pushing them and apparently the owners -- to do the building, so even though the buildings they are doing they donâ€™t move too fast, thatâ€™s my feeling of what Iâ€™d seen going on.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thielman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And thatâ€™s helpful. And starting to kind of the weather affected regions side that you serve, what states can you kind of point to where you seems kind of this outside? It seems like everything we hear is Texas is till buoyant but curious sort of the energy impacted regions you mentioned in Middle East?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. It hasnâ€™t gone down the â€“ by any means, itâ€™s still a buoyant market. But it was roaring and going there for long time and the oils drop back didnâ€™t kill it, but it surely slowed it down. The one that really were strongest historical markets that the Northeastern United States, very strongest market weâ€™ve had and it took off an awful bleeding [ph] this past winter and that really hurt us. But the energy market just trampled down to more to the -- it was moving along must faster than it is today.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thielman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then kind of help them pieces together, you mean comment in your release sort of suggest kind of cloudy out for the year, but it sounds like youâ€™re seeing Q2 and Q3 working a little better than last year and Q4 should be quite a bit better, am I reading that correctly?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Norman Asbjornson</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Brent, it looks like weâ€™re seeing it present time.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thielman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay.
