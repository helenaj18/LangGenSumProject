We're very excited to have Frederick Crawford, CFO of Aflac with us today. For those of you who are less familiar with Aflac, a supplemental health and life insurance provider operated in both, the U.S. and Japan. The format we're going to use today is a fireside chat. So we'll go straight into it. First let me say welcome, thanks for being here with us.</p> <p><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p>Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it, thanks for inviting us.</p> <p><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. So I guess to start, maybe we'll talk about the growth avenues in Japan. If you could discuss some of the strategic shifts that have been occurring there over the past few years, new distribution partners, and how you see the third sector evolving over the next couple of years.</p> <p><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="iS_EF">So in terms of some of the dynamics affecting our growth rate in Japan, I would say a couple of things; one is, there are some underlying catalyst that we think support our business model in Japan. Most of you are familiar with the challenges of economic growth in Japan and the ageing population, the ageing and shrinking workforce and those are all dynamics that certainly weigh on economic expansion, they weigh on the capital markets in Japan, interest rates and alike but in our business, those same sorts of dynamics are bringing about an ageing population in Japan and with that ageing population is an increased natural, increased demand for supplemental healthcare policies, both medical and particularly cancer. The other dynamic you're seeing is that same population dynamic is also putting financial pressure on the Japanese government and the sustainability of their national healthcare system<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> and so they are shifting more of the burden and have been shifting more of the burden onto the Japanese policy holder or Japanese citizen, that has made for greater opportunity for supplemental health coverages like what Aflac provides and<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> as a leader at third sector, which is essentially medical, cancer related products that puts us in a good position to continue to grow and build the business.</span></span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Having said that though, the medical business in Japan -- medical supplemental business in Japan is very highly penetrated in and around 70% plus penetration and so it's also very crowded and very competitive. Unlike the cancer business where we have in our case 60% market share and it is less penetrated business approaching say 40% penetration and we see awareness picking up and we see the demand for our products picking up. And so we have been actively engaged in really a couple of different strategies in Japan that try to ride this catalyst and this opportunity. One is, we periodically refresh our products, every other year we refresh our medical product and that stays current with the types of coverage and treatments in the system in Japan, and that usually provides a catalyst to sales and a boost to sales in the year where we're refreshing the product. In the case of cancer, it's about every four years that we refresh and that provides a good jump to the business because there has been lots of advancements in medical treatments in -patient, out-patient in particular, advancements and then early detection and forms of experimental treatment that become more normalized treatment for cancer and all of that means an expanded opportunity for coverage and demand for the product. So those are the things that are sort of driving our third sector business in general.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">From a strategic standpoint, what we did do however is we pulled back more dramatically from first sector savings products, these would be traditional type of annuity cash value life insurance type policies, deposit oriented products and that's because of not only the low interest rate but also the reserving requirements on those products are quite strenuous and so you end up really having difficulty achieving the internal rate of return you want on the products and so we've priced those products accordingly and we've seen a big pullback that's helpful and that it creates the -- positions ourselves for more economic value growth in Japan because we see much more value over the long run in our third sector of core business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the investing you're doing to spread more growth? I think you talked a bit about it earlier this year at the financial analyst briefing; some of the things you're doing with digital investing, investment and distribution and so forth. I mean, you talked about some of those things like what are the tangible things that we can think of that are contributing to growth of the next couple of years?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In Japan, you know, we can't just be cancer-medical, medical-cancer, cancer-medical; we have to expand our product line, and we've been doing that in terms of new forms of say income or disability supplemental riders, we've now put renewed focus on first sector protection products which is more and more [indiscernible] products but on the digital front we've also developed digital product and this is a product that is a medical supplemental product but it can be purchased digitally, i.e. you can purchase and manage the product from your cell phone but also it's been designed around the millennial population to open up a new demographic, it is a health underwritten product, meaning, it taps into biometrics and if you maintain a healthy lifestyle, we can underwrite your health age as opposed to your actual age. So if you're 40 years old but have the health characteristics of a 35-year old, we can underwrite you to 35 and the way it works is in the form of a rebating if you will, a refunding of your premium. You will get premium back if you maintain those types of health statistics overtime over the life of owning the policy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it opens up a younger demographic, it creates a digital avenue to sell product, it creates natural persistency because you're now incentive to not only remain healthy but hang on to this product as you remain healthy, you get rewarded if you will each year as you maintain your health and hang on to the policy. And because we've attracted a younger generation, we can now carry that generation into the older years when they start considering broader medical supplemental coverage, cancer coverage, disability coverage etcetera. So, we also see it as lead generation in Japan for traditional agent sold.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Beyond that in Japan, we have opened up an innovation shop in Shibuya; Shibuya is the technology center of Tokyo area and Japan; and we have a floor there effectively, it's portion of a floor of a building that has been retrofitted around innovation technology and more of a lab in research. And there we are developing, it's where we have our venture capital investments that we make, it's where we incubate new ideas, like the gap product which is this digital product I mentioned. And in that area, we're looking for opportunities to where we can provide digital solutions to pain points and the customer experience, do similar thing in the U.S. There is several -- the pain points for buying insurance in general, whether be in Japan or the U.S. is what I will call a target rich environment. It is not easy buying situation for most clients and even when you have the policies not necessarily an easy situation for you when you go on claim and you manage and work with your insurance company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We think we're one of the best at it, things like one-day pay and other things make our particular franchise very good but we look for those pain points, whether it be the policy holder, the agent, the broker, and we use digital technology or digital means to close that pain point, it's simple as that. Maybe we can eliminate the pain point, often times we can't eliminate it but we can shrink it quite dramatically through digital application and that's everything from using optical technology, voice recognition technology, being able to do more things on your phone, be more self-service, and that's where we're making investments. In the U.S. we have a similar level, it's in Charlotte, North Carolina, we brought a company, and Charlotte's not an accident. As you know, we're sitting here at a financial service conference, Charlotte is the retail headquarters for Wells Fargo, Bank of America, there is a tremendous fin-tech [ph] environment in that area of the country. And for us it was a nice natural location for us to house and build up some technology and digital expertise, both in company and outside the company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And there we're developing our direct-to-consumer business model, as well as incubating other technologies that we think can change the customer experience. In the U.S. that customer experience is largely revolving around the small business customer experience, the agent experience, the broker experience.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I guess the next question I have for you is; just around how this all translates to revenue growth. I think the revenue growth that you guided to -- I think it's actually decline in revenue, at least in the near-term, and so it feels like there is this -- maybe this disconnect between how much effort is being put into the digital initiatives and the investment you're doing relative to other peers in the life insurance industry and sort of like [indiscernible]. So we'd be interested to hear like when do you expect to really start benefiting from some of these actions you're taking?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think if you're not known as a digital industry, technology industry; to me it stands to reason that investors in particular would say when you show me the money, I'll get more encouraged and so I personally think it's rational that investors and observers which say I want to see the fruits of these investments before I convince that it can mean more dynamic growth for the company and that to me is very reasonable. And so we just have to stick to our netting and invest, and the thing I would say to you is, the areas we think have great opportunity is one; we think digital delivery of our product is a new area and a dynamic opportunity, both in Japan and in the U.S. and we think the demand for product on that basis is maturing and it's going to continue to mature. The market share digitally delivered insurance product is growing but it's small part of the marketplace. What I like about our product is that it is a simple product, we do not have a complex product, it's a very simple product to understand, it serves a simple purpose, it pays you cash directly; we have every opportunity to have a great customer experience and a very satisfying experience as compared to most complex forms of insurance. We sell in the U.S. at the work site and the work site is naturally demanding more technology and more customer centric ease of doing business for their employees. And so we have a lot of opportunity to I think make inroads on the digital side as a company overtime but it's going to take time. This is still an industry where the product are largely still sold versus bought which means I think you're going to see a combination of true direct-to-consumer digital and agent-assisted digital platforms to deliver the product. But it's all about customer ease of doing business, that's really what it's about.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now from Aflac's perspective, I mean, something to be mindful of is, yes, we suffer from the law of large numbers and 60 plus years of success and high growth rates in the U.S. and 40 plus years of dynamic growth rates in Japan. And by that meaning, when you have 26 million policies in Japan, that lapse at 6% a year and you've got 13 million policies in the U.S. that lapse at north of 20% a year, you have to have one heck of a sales generating capability to keep pace with that natural lapsation in the blocks of business; that means your earned premium is going to be challenged to grow beyond the single-digit -- low single-digit type dynamic and in the U.S. we're growing in the 2% to 3% range earned premium, and in Japan we're actually coming down 1% because we made the proactive decision to move away from first sector savings which brings assets and investment risk and other things that could be challenging in Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Meanwhile, our third sector is growing at the 2% plus range, and when you have the dominant market share we have and 1-in-4 households in Japan, and 460,000 small businesses that we work with in the U.S. where we're 3x our next largest competitor, growing at those low single-digit levels is not a small amount of growth in actual premium, actual dollars, and if we can maintain our margins, that's a good bottom-line growth rate, particularly when you're using excess capital to buyback stock on top of that. Now, with that maturing business model you start throwing off a lot of cash flow and I think what's very important for us is that we need to segregate out a portion of that cash flow to make sure we're investing in that next generation of technology in digital, it's both offensive and defensive. You've asked the question in an offensive way, but remember there are players out there that could look to disturb the marketplace we're in and we want to be the one that would get there first if there is such a technology or capability.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so we're playing both defense and offense with our investments, both protecting our franchise and looking to grow it. But it's going to be next horizon type growth, there is no question, it's not going to be something, we're just not the type of business model, our industry is not the type of business model where you wave along and all the sudden sales are up dramatically, in fact, are in an industry where if sales are up dramatically, there is an old saying, if it grows like a weed, it might be a weed; that is the situation in the insurance industry, you're going to be asking me more questions if the growth is too dynamic, right. What kind of business are you selling, what kind of risk are you taking, what is the underwrite type [ph] of it, have you priced it properly, those are all questions you will ask me. So we want to be measured and careful about it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I guess a related question; you've mentioned persistency [ph] lapses; I'll be interested if you can talk more about just -- some of the dynamics in Japan, with lapsation and what it's done to the benefit ratio and sort of -- where you would expect that third sector margin to trend as a result of these lapses occurring?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Number one, we enjoy very strong pre-tax profit margins, both in Japan and the U.S., and in Japan, our pre-tax profit margin has been hovering around 20% which is as strong as any part of our industry frankly, including in Japan. And so we have very good margins in the business, we have very stable and high quality margins where morbidity play, and so we cannot see too much in the way of volatility in our morbidity when you've got 26 million policies outstanding in Japan and 13 million in U.S. So it's a very high quality, very stable and consistent and strong margin we have. Now, when you look at things like the dynamics that are at play, and that -- let's call it combined ratio, benefit ratio and expense ratio, in Japan we have high persistency but when we introduce new product, whether it be a medical product or most recently, this year a cancer product, there will be a level of heightened lapsation for a period of time because you will have people that own our policies and because of the marked improvement in the policy, new coverage capabilities, new treatments that are being covered and other features, they often will opt to replace their old policy with the new policy; and the way that works is an outright lapsation of the old policy and the sale of a new policy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So on the old policy you're releasing the reserves on that policy which if it's an older policy, that's a benefit to your benefit ratio and your bottom-line, but if it's a younger policy, you're also typically writing-off the deck or the acquisition cost that you've capitalized which will increase your expense ratio. And so in years when we are offering up a new -- particularly a new cancer product where it's been 4 years since we've refreshed the product and we're in sizeable distribution channels like Japan post, which is probably one of the other more dynamic strategies that has taken place in recent years last 4 years or so, selling cancer insurance of 20,000 post-offices, you will see a heightened level of lapse and replacement and that will play with your benefit ratio in that year lowering it and it will tick up your expense ratio but the bottom-line should be either net to the positive or unaffected, and that's largely what we saw this year; a little better pre-tax profit margins because some of the business that lapse and reissued was older cancer business, so we released more reserves than we wrote off DAC, but that's not an unusual dynamic and as a result we're expecting stable margins into 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">If we could switch over to the U.S.; I think one of the things that surprised me a little bit is just following tax reform, there are some expectation that pricing competition would maybe grow at some of the supplemental products and benefit ratios have continue to be favorable; I think in the financial analyst briefing you made comments suggesting they are more favorable than sort of how you're pricing today. How much longer would you expect them to be favorable? What are you seeing in terms of competition and in terms of pricing?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">There is more competition on pricing, first of all, the tax reform did not have a marked impact in my view on pricing and competition and margins in the sense of -- we have not seen marked aggressiveness in the products, and I think that's because these are relatively inexpensive products that are sold in the work side through payroll deduction, it's a bit of a different dynamic than you might find with other products in terms of pricing elasticity. But in terms of the actual margins on the product, it's a bit more competitive as you can imagine in the brokerage space because you are being lined up against other products, you in some cases faced competition from folks that are bundling if you will, group, and/or major medical with supplemental. So it can be more competitive there but overall, still strong margin business and operating well above our cost of capital we have among the lowest cost of capital in the industry. And so still very good margins and very good return on capital, haven't seen a lot of movement in pricing, Aflac being such a dominant player in the marketplace, we drive in some respects, some of the pricing in the marketplace, and we also have such great scale that we spread our expenses over a great number of policies compared to our competitors, so we bring a lower expense ratio to the table and that allows us to compete.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I don't feel that if pricing pressure is the issue, one interesting thing to think about in the U.S. is there is 170 million workers in the U.S. and we do business with, as I mentioned earlier, about 450,000, 460,000 businesses in the U.S.; those businesses employ about approximately 47 million, 48 million of that 170 million workers in the U.S. Of that 47 million who have the ability to buy our product at any point in time because it's being offered in their workplace, not quite 8 million of them have our product. And the reason I say such relatively low penetration despite our size, and the reason I say that is to me it's not about price competition, it's about penetration. For every one piece of business I lose in the way of say price competition with the competitor, I have an opportunity to sell 3 or 4 or 5 policies by just convincing the marketplace of the value proposition of a supplemental health policy. Though price is not the challenge in the U.S., it's really penetration and a recognition of the value proposition of the product so that it can expand the penetration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In Japan, a little bit different; cancer we feel good about, first sector protection, we stay in the game but we're not looking to be a price leader. Medical insurance in Japan is a different dynamic, very competitive price competition, feature competition, we have about 16% market share which is a leading market share but it's much more heavily competitive, large players involved, sophisticated players, and so that's where we will see some challenges in maintaining margins as we go forward and in my view is the medical business. So we have to be creative to try to defend that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Maybe switching over to capital for a minute; when I look across the different sources of excess capital, I mean, IRBC [ph] ratio relative to the risk in the U.S., strong economic solvency ratio in Japan, give a lot of hold-co cash, I think you probably have a pretty significant amount of debt capacity. All of these things combined would give you fair amount of fire power. I mean is there anything that you would consider beyond just the digital investment that you've kind of outlined that would be bigger and more transformative for the company?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's interesting, so let me just make a couple of comments. One, we by definition have not been and are not an acquisitive company but it's very important for us to be in the game to understand what opportunities are in the marketplace because people I think don't give enough credit to is being involved in the corporate development dynamics in Japan, in the U.S., allows you to get highly educated in what dynamics are taking place in the marketplace. It gives you a better realization of where you have gaps in your strategy, in areas to improve and then every once in a while you may in fact find a property that makes perfect sense and you want to pull the trigger on it. But we don't tend to think of our business model as being in need of acquisition help, when we look at the gaps in our strategy, there aren't too many, when you've got the leading brand in the U.S. and Japan, the deepest and widest distribution, the largest scale, and you have a broad array of products that meet all the needs of the voluntary marketplace, work side marketplace in the U.S. and supplemental marketplace in Japan, you don't stare at your business model and say we really lack the following and should acquire our way into it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And over and over again, what ends up happening is build ends up being as provocative as buy and the reason for it is what we tend to bring to the table is massive distribution. When we have 460,000 business clients and 26 million, one in every four household as an Aflac product in Japan, we're bringing all that access to the client and so we typically would not find it attractive to pay good -- to book goodwill and pay a premium for a property when we're the one that's going to bring the growth rate to the table. So you just don't find it to be particularly attractive, when you switch gears on technology and digital and venture and alternative distribution methods, now it's gets much more attractive because now you can apply that to all of those core competencies that we possessed and really leverage the platform to do something dynamic with it and if often accelerates what other-wise is a loner road of technology. But something to keep in mind is, just to put it in perspective, all the digital investments we're talking about, we generate -- if you look at our outlook hall [ph] yesterday, we talked about in next year we're going to generate between $2.7 billion and $3 billion in year of 2019 of deployable capital. And if you remove the $500 million of excess capital that we're pulling out of the U.S. then you're into a $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion a year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When I look at all of our digital investments, everything from our $250 million venture capital fund of which only roughly $60 million is invested and I look at the empowered which is our North Carolina, our Charlotte based property which I paid $35 million for, plus a $5 million contingency and have about 80 people working there, and the Shibuya office in Japan which is a little office, about maybe say twice the size of this room that has 30 or so people and they are working on innovation. You're talking about downhill with the wind, I have invested $400 million over the next several years in what I would call digital and venture driving that investment, that's on generating $2.5 billion a year free cash flow. So this is a very small bet if you will in terms of capital investment for what might be the potential pay-off of both dynamically shifting and enhancing your business growth and defending the franchise you have, it is just simply a no-brainer to make these types of investments from a return-on-capital standpoint.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we have a $800 million a year common stock dividend, we're at 36 years into increasing the dividend and we plan to do that, we've been buying back our stock at high rates and I just guided to $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion of stock buyback. So we are delivering plenty of capital back to the shareholder while really taking a fairly minor chunk out of that to stay, we better be on top of the digital technology and innovation side of things given the business we're in. I think that's very prudent.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I guess the other thing I wanted to touch on during this conversation was just some of the upcoming accounting changes. As we have now issued, I guess -- new accounting regime for 1Q 2021, which is quite a way down the future but I think some of your products are exposed to some of the changes related to FAS16 [ph] and some of your -- I think the way the Japan business is encountered for and so forth, so I'd be interested to hear any kind of color you can give us on that, any differences between retrospective versus methodology and your ability to do for retro if that is the preferred method?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I'm happy to, it's interesting when I talk to investors and outside observers, they say it's a bit -- it's ways off and when I talk to our internal accounting and actuarial team, it's right around the corner and that's because it is an enormous project, as you know for all companies in our industry, it's a significant lift to adopt this change on a timely basis and do it right, and so we are actively engaged in doing it. I would say right out of the gate, these two big methodologies that you have to decide on and that is retrospective versus modified retrospective, we have not made a decision on that but I would tell you that the decision framework is very similar to what you've heard from other companies we're no different, meaning, there is a tremendous amount of work and energy required if you were to choose to go retrospective and needing to go really back into time and gather substantial information and it's a big lift and it causes most companies to say is it worth that type of an effort and is that really where we want to spend our time and money and does it actually deliver a better outcome for reporting our results on a go-forward basis, is it somehow more understandable, more transparent or what have you [ph].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I think a lot of companies are sighting the direction of modified retrospective for those reasons but we haven't made a decision. The other thing that's out there is, well you early adopt and I would tell you that I don't know where most companies are but the reason I made the comment of just around the corner when you talked about 2021 is from our standpoint, we would not early adopt. We are more likely to adopt on the timeframe that's been dictated so far. What we are ready to talk about and able to talk about is not numbers and impact but rather what are the areas of the P&amp;L of balance sheet that we are focused on; I made a comment I think a couple of quarters ago that it's not so much about the new accounting implementation, it's more about one set of rules and conditions being applied to very different business models in the industry and how that comes through. And in our case, we have a very unique business model, we are uniquely 70% to 80% Japan depending on how you measure it, and we have a third sector concentrated business and really a morbidity business in the U.S.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So as a result, we are going to have a unique model when we adopt but I would say in general is the following and that is we have very strong morbidity margins that comes through in our cash flow testing and it comes through in our statutory earnings and FSA earnings in Japan, very strong GAAP margins on gross premium valuation and those strong and stable margins should still be the case under the new accounting, there will be more volatility but more volatility on a business model that is very stable in terms of it's pure margins, both in Japan and the U.S. DAC amortization will be strung out a little bit more so it will tend to be a little lower because we -- there are some products where we amortize the DAC quicker and under the new adoption it will be spread-out a little bit more. And then all companies will not have provisions for adverse deviation or pads that apply to the reserving they set up on new products on a GAAP basis and so that will mean less reserves as you set up your products which means a bit more margin but a bit more volatility because you will unlocking those reserves each quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think the other dynamic is so-called below the line in AOCI. You are going to be applying a discount rate now to the liabilities much like you have in unrealized gain or loss position on your assets, you're going to have a similar type position by applying a discount rate to the liabilities. So if you naturally have asset liability mismatch which is typically the case with Japanese insurance companies because we have long duration third sector businesses, don't confuse it with annuities and long-term care and these types of businesses but long duration third sector and a shorter duration asset portfolio. You're going to naturally have a little bit more variability in the gains and losses on the asset side versus the gains and losses on the liability. If you couple that with being a company that has a lot of health to maturity assets on their balance sheet where there is no gains or losses recorded through AOCI, you will end up with even a little more exaggeration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I think what's going to be the case for the industry and Aflac is no different is that, you will see sort of the strength, the strength you've come to -- grown accustom to in terms of the margins and the earnings power of the company and the stability of the company, you will see no implications to cash flow, capital generation to capital usage, but very typical of AOCI, and unrealized gains and losses on bonds, you're going to have to explain why those numbers are the way they are and why they react the way they do, and what I've said to people all along is I'm convinced the new accounting is going to drive everybody towards economic value approaches, it's going to cause you to pay very careful attention to statutory results in the U.S. and in our case statutory or FSA results in Japan; you're going to be looking at the cash flow generation and cash flow yield of stocks, you're going to be doing that because it's going to be much more volatile on a GAAP basis so you're going to want to see the real economic generation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And that piece of it actually gets me excited because our business model is naturally a very strong economic value business model with on a relative basis lower volatility. So that's what we're building up, it's not just the adoption of the new accounting but the realization that we need to advance the ball on our economic transparency and metrics in light of that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Can we open it up to see if there is questions from the audience. So maybe I will give you one more. Just in light of the switch trade that you guys have put in, there has been some different asset allocations that have kind of occurred over the last couple of years, anything you've seen in your asset portfolio just in light of widening credit spreads and a bit more concern around credit. Are you seeing anything in your portfolio that gives you any pause? Any of the stuff you bought more recently? Any update on how that's performing?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Interestingly we continue to monitor carefully, frankly, older privates that we bought because they are somewhat concentrated, they are little less liquid, and we have done a lot of derisking in that area and so we are far better position today than of course we were several years ago. So we are less concerned about it, but we still watch it because of the nature of those holdings but we feel like we're in decent shape, we've actually done a fair amount of derisking throughout the year which doesn't bode well for net investment income as you go in '19 because a lot of those holdings that we've derisked we're at higher coupon levels but we think it's prudent if you think, there could be some credit weakness. When you say switch trades, some of what we have done is actually quite tactical that is not credit risk related, it's actually credit improvement and that we've -- with the tax reform we did the calculations and figured out that the after-tax return on capital allocated to munnies [ph] for us was a beneficial asset class to be in, so we sold out to corporates where we were fearing a widening spread and possible credit cycle and went into munnies [ph], and that's unique for the insurance industry. Last time the life insurance industry went to munnies [ph] was build America bonds, and so this is a bit new but we like that trade. The only other dynamic I would tell you is we clearly have been sighting towards building up loans, the loan portfolio, middle market loans and transition of real estate, that's because it's particularly attractive for us because it's a type of U.S. security that we can hedge efficiently in Japan, so we can hold it on our Japanese portfolio, it does expose you to LIBOR rates which has been a helper this -- I hear recently as you all know, that also comes however with rising hedge costs, and so we have to manage the hedge cost and LIBOR rate dynamic. What I would say is we like those loans better; one, they are accounted for as loans, so they are less volatile from an unrealized gain/loss position when it comes to our SMR ratio which is our capital ratio in Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But the other is they tend to come with a covenant structure, and that gives you a little bit of added protection relative to say a traditional below investment grade bonds because many of these middle market loans are BB-type category bonds, sometimes lower and we'd rather be in that than be in a -- a true below investment-grade security. Transitional real estate, we favor and that's because it's highly -- it's more higher rated, it tends to be more BBB-rated and we've got some good external managers that no other doing in that asset class and we have confidence in them.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Alright, thank you for being with us today.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Frederick Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great.
