Limited">AEM</a></span>) Virtual John Tumazos Very Independent Research Conference June 21, 2022 11:00 AM ET</p> <p><strong>Company Participants</strong></p> <p>Aurea Dela Resma - Director, Investor Relations</p> <p><strong>Conference Call Participants</strong></p> <p>John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research</p> <p><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p>Good morning. We're very pleased to have Aurea Dela Resma, the Director of Investor Relations at Agnico Eagle. There's many developments. So without further ado, please give us the updates.</p> <p><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p>Thanks, John. I'm happy to be here today to provide an overview on Agnico Eagle. Before I start the presentation, I just want to make note that we have forward-looking statements in this presentation. So please make note of that.</p> <p>So to begin, the merger of equals with Kirkland Lake Gold made headlines as we created one of the highest quality senior gold producers. We continue to have a simple, consistent, disciplined and proven approach to value creation. Agnico has a high-quality portfolio, is a leader in terms of ESG stewardship and is expected to continue to generate superior long-term returns to shareholders.</p> <p>Starting with the high-quality portfolio to the left of the slide, we have a strategy of growing production per share, and we do this by operating regions where we can operate for decades due to the geological potential in that region and are also in places where we can actually do business with supportive governments and communities.</p> <p>In 2022, we are expected to produce between 3.2 million ounces and 3.4 million ounces with stable gold production in future years. This robust production profile with low cash costs are expected to be in the 725 to 775 per ounce range and is expected to generate strong margins and cash flows at current gold prices.</p> <p class="iS_EF">There also continues to be growth opportunities near mine sites, and we<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> also have a pipeline of high-quality exploration and development assets. We'll go through some of these key value drivers later in the presentation.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">We also have the opportunity to add value through synergies from the merger with Kirkland Lake Gold. There's opportunities to generate lower cost as well as generate<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> more gold production, which I'll also go over in more detail later in the presentation.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of ESG stewardship, for 65 years, we've been on a journey to build a high-quality business for the benefit of all. As we are a partner of choice within our industry, we are committed to fostering positive and collaborative relationships with local communities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As early as possible, we seek to engage and partner with local stakeholders, indigenous groups and to assess the level of social acceptability and potential impacts of the project within the community.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At Agnico, we appreciate the need and overall benefit of supporting local businesses and maximizing local procurement. Our approach is focused on establishing mutually beneficial cooperative and productive relationships.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We also continue to be recognized for leading industry practices by independent ESG rating agencies. We are already recognized - we are already recognized leaders in the environmental performance with some of the lowest water consumption intensity and GHG emissions in the mining industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our last section on the right-hand side of the slide relates to generating long-term returns for shareholders. Agnico has a strong financial position and at the end of the first quarter of 2022, the total liquidity position was $2.3 billion with net debt of approximately $500 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to focus on growing per share metrics with a disciplined capital approach. This strategy has enabled us to have a long history of capital returns to shareholders. In fact, 2022 marks 39th consecutive year of paying dividends. We also announced a share buyback earlier this year that was initiated this quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now taking a closer look at the regions in which we operate, Agnico has operations in premier mining jurisdictions. We currently have 11 operating mines in 4 countries: Canada, Mexico, Finland and Australia, and we are currently the third largest gold producer and by far, the largest gold producer in Canada.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our high concentration - a high concentration of our mines are shown on the right-hand - top right-hand box and are located in the Abitibi greenstone belt of Northeastern Ontario and Northwestern Quebec. This region is where we see the majority of the synergies expected to be generated from the merger with Kirkland Lake. And as previously mentioned, we'll go over this in more detail later in the presentation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">While we do have 11 operating lines, our asset portfolio continues to be low risk and manageable. As mentioned, our 4 mines are concentrated in 4 countries and 5 top-tier mining jurisdictions. So we continue to run a very manageable business due to the regional concentration of our assets. As shown on this chart, our business is less complex and in less risky mining jurisdictions when compared to our peers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving on to ESG. Our ESG strategy is built on 4 key pillars: engaging with our communities and indigenous partners, pursuing innovation with the adaptation of new technologies and embracing outside-the-box thinking, identifying and eliminating or mitigating risk to protect our operations, employees, communities and the environment; and lastly, adapting to new realities and evolving to meet new challenges.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">One example of this was dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Nunavut. In December 2021, due to the increased spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, we made the decision to send home the Nunavut based workforce as a precaution to protect the Nunavut and local residents. This decision was made in collaboration with the Nunavut health authorities. As the COVID-19 situation improved in Q1, the Nunavut workforce was back fully integrated in the operations this past April.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of ESG reporting, yesterday, we published our 2021 sustainability report. It marks the 13th year that we've produced a detailed account of our health, safety, environmental and social performance. While our merger with Kirkland Lake was not completed until February 2022, we included information relating to the legacy Kirkland Lake operations in the report. This report can be found on our website.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Already, we are recognized leaders in environmental performance with some of the lowest energy intensity and GHG emissions in the mining industry, as mentioned previously. We are committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2050 or sooner, and we are mapping out key milestones to achieve our carbon neutrality goals. An update on our climate strategy is expected later in 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And lastly, we are recognized for our leading industry practices in ESG by independent rating agencies, as shown in the table on the bottom right. We are also proud to be recognized by Corporate Knights as one of the top-ranked mining companies on its list of the 2021 Global 100 most Sustainable Corporations and is part of the best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Taking a look at the next slide, as we mentioned, Agnico has a track record of adding value per share. Our focus continues to be on creating value per share. With the merger completed in the first quarter of 2022, Q2 will be the first quarter of production from Detour, Macassa and Fosterville, which is expected to drive earnings and operating cash flow in the remainder of the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are expecting steady growth from the midpoint of guidance for the next few years, and it's being anchored by 6 cornerstone assets that produce more than 300,000 ounces per year. These mines are Detour, Fosterville, Meliadine, LaRonde, Meadowbank and our 50% share of Canadian Malartic.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To further support growth and value creation, 2022 marks a record exploration budget of $324 million and growth capital of $700 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Development capital mean total CapEx?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No. It's actually just the - what we call growth capital. There is sustaining capital, which is also about $700 million. So our total capital for the year is $1.4 billion.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We expect...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the [Indiscernible] exploration will be written off?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No. So about $130 million of the $324 million is capitalized and the rest will be expensed.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So cap spending, as we see it, will be about [15.30] (ph).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, that's correct.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Could you explain whether the 3 or 4 biggest chunks of the $324 million exploration budget?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. So the biggest chunk would be - actually, there's probably 4 areas that create - that have a big component of the exploration budget, first being Fosterville. So we're looking to - our objective is to find a higher grade zone at Fosterville.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Also at Detour, we have a significantly large budget at Hope Bay, which is now focused on exploration. There's a substantial budget there, and we also have a decent sized budget at Macassa as well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So Hope Bay and Holt in the northern territories, each legacy company idled production to focus better on exploration and underground development and to have a big enough resource critical mass to produce properly and efficiently.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">How long do you think these pauses are practical? And is there a specific time horizon where the exploration to restart phase sort of has a deadline where it's not practical to dewater and be on care and maintenance forever.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. So I guess one of the most recent mines that we put on care and maintenance to focus on exploration is Hope Bay. We've committed to exploring for the next 2 years, and we're looking for a larger production scenario. I'll talk a little bit more about that later on in the presentation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But really, what we're looking for there is scale. So it's just a matter of being able to get the work done, having the drillers available in order to get the drilling that we want done there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As far as timeline goes, it would just basically be a matter of exploration results and whether if you see there's continued potential there. So I would say there's not a necessarily set timeline, but as time goes on, it obviously makes it a little bit more difficult to restart operation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So the exploration the philosophy of Agnico from the days before Sean, back even in the Paul Penna days, was very patient. And I remember, Paul, giving the geologists $1 million and telling them to go look after they gave up on projects, where Kirkland was more focused on their 3 big assets and seem to deemphasize things as immaterial.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So maybe 3 years ago at PDAC, there was a core shack with a drill core from the [lander] (ph) zone. They had a VG particle as big as a nickel. And there was a test mining, and it was shut down as immaterial and the Australian geologists at the PDAC booth the next year couldn't explain why it was shut down. It's not an example of a situation where maybe Agnico would be more patient in the vein of Paul, Penna. How is the issue of materiality now that we're a bigger company, could we continue to like little projects that can get bigger?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So even though we're a larger company, our focus is still on the drill bit. It's still on starting small and growing deposit - so that has not changed with the merger. What has changed is now we have a lot more projects to allocate our resources to.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it's just a matter of the exploration team taking a look at how they want to balance their budget and where they want to allocate their resources to the priorities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Excuse me for interrupting.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Not a problem, not a problem. So moving on to the next slide. Here, we've outlined 4 key value drivers. The first value driver that we have on this slide is the Odyssey project, which remains on schedule and on budget. This project is considered an employer of choice in the Abitibi region, so recruitment for the project is overall going well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the first quarter of 2021, underground development was generally in line with the plan and the headframe and waste room construction continued to progress. Shaft sinking is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first production from the underground is expected in the first half of 2023 via the ramp.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next, we have Detour. Technical evaluation is currently underway, and that evaluation is focused on converting resources to reserves, updating the life of mine and including mill optimization projects that are designed to increase the mill throughput to 28 million tonnes per year by 2025.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In 2021, Detour Lake processed a record 24 million tonnes, and in 2022, we're expecting to process approximately 26 million tonnes. We expect to provide an update on the results of the current study with the second quarter results in July.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the exploration side, drilling continues to intersect mineralization to the west of the pit and also mineralization has been encountered at depth, which could support future underground mining. An evaluation is also being planned to assess the potential for an underground operation and the expansion of production to 32 million tonnes per year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At the Macassa mining hub, work is ongoing on the underground ramp from Macassa to reach the AK deposit, which is the AK deposits previous was -- is a property that was owned by legacy Agnico, and it's very close to the property boundary of Macassa and lies within a few hundred meters of the existing Macassa underground infrastructure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At Q1, the ramp was extended by 224 meters and drilling had begun. We could expect the ore from the AK deposit that could be processed at the Macassa mill as early as 2024. Also at Upper Beaver, which is located about 27 kilometers from the Macassa Mine, exploration drilling is underway to investigate for new mineralized zones at depth in a long strike laterally.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Infill drilling continues to intersect significant mineralization and appears to have encountered a new zone of mineralization, 500 meters southeast of the main mineralized zone. We continue to review project development scenarios for Upper Beaver. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And lastly, we have Hope Bay. This project was acquired from TMAC Resources in February 2021, and the focus is now on exploration, which is expected to continue through 2023. We are looking to evaluate a larger production scenario and to develop an optimal production strategy around the geological potential of the land package.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Internal evaluations are underway regarding the potential to operate a 4,000 tonne per day mine that could ultimately produce 250,000 ounces to 300,000 ounces per year at reasonable capital costs and capital spending levels.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For at least - we're looking for a period of at least 12 - operating period for at least 12 to 15 years. We've also - we're also evaluating whether or not we can -- we should retrofit the Doris mill or build a new mill closer to the Madrid deposit.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Aurea how much production might come from Odyssey in 2023 or 2024?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are - so the majority of the production will actually start once the shaft sinking has been completed in 2029. From the period of 2023 to 2028, we're looking at about 930 ounces that come from Odyssey.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Or a little over 100,000 a year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. It's going to ramp up so it will be a little bit less at the beginning, but yes, roughly speaking.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So in terms of East Gouldie in 2029, I was in Quebec in American Thanksgiving week in November. And the East Gouldie head frame appeared to be 20 stories high in built. Is it possible this 2029 schedule is a little conservative?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's - we're doing a phased approach. Like the shaft head frame is - well shaft sinking is not beginning until Q4. It's going to be a shaft that can call about 20,000 tons per day. It's quite a big shaft. So it will take some time in order to get down to a level that we needed to.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Why was the head frame erected a year before the shaft sinking it would seem not capital efficient. It would seem like it's better to sink that shaft fast and get to the gold.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It was just the timing of how the engineers decided to structure the project.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Excuse me.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we will because the first 600 meters of the deposit is being mined via ramp and then the under 600 meters is being mined through the shaft. So we are still getting production in those first [Indiscernible] while the shaft sinking is taking place.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So in addition to our focus on the key value drivers, an important component of the work that's ongoing since the merger with Kirkland Lake Gold is on synergies and optimization. We expect about $2 billion of pretax synergies over 10 years grouped into 3 separate buckets that are outlined on this slide.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">First, we have corporate synergies, operational synergies and strategic optimization. Beginning with corporate synergies, which are the primary driver of the realized synergies in the first quarter of 2022, to date, we've achieved $45 million in corporate synergies from a reduction in personnel costs, service and insurance costs and also a reduction in office spaces.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That being that we only need one lawyer or one auditor and one consolidated office space for our head office. We are now anticipating that corporate synergies are in the range of $40 million to $50 million per year higher than the previous estimate of $35 million per year. On operational synergies, we are targeting savings of about $130 million per year, which is approximately $30 to $40 per ounce. Items not flow into this category include procurement and taking advantage of economies of scale with a larger company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And other examples include operational improvement and a centralized control room in the Abitibi region. Lastly, we have strategic optimization. An example of this is mining from the 8-K deposit that was discussed on the previous slide. This project could add approximately 400 -- sorry, could add approximately 40,000 ounces on average per year and could see production as early as 2023. A 1.3-kilometer exploration ramp in the near surface area is being developed this year in order to access and infill drill the AK deposit. Permitting work is continuing and a production decision could be reached later in 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Overall, work on synergies and optimization has been better than expected, with the 2022 relayed synergies expected to be in the top end of the $40 million to $68 million range. We'll be providing a further update on synergies with our Q2 2020 results -- now taking a look at growth in operating margin. As previously mentioned, Q2 will be the first full quarter of production for the legacy Kirkland Lake assets Detour Fosterville and Macassa. The production growth from these assets as well as our legacy Agnico assets are expected to drive significant free cash flow at current gold prices. Estimated mine operating profit is shown on this chart.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And after deducting for capital, exploration, G&amp;A, interest, cash taxes and current dividends, the rising cash flow could potentially be used for further increases in dividends to fund future growth in the pipeline and to reduce net debt. Not only do we expect strong operating margins, but we also have a strong balance sheet. We have available liquidity of about $2.3 billion.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And as of the end of Q1 2022, it comprised of $1.3 billion of cash and $1.2 billion in undrawn credit lines. Our total net debt is around $500 million. And at the end of -- that was as of the end of March. And in April, on April 7, we repaid debt of approximately $125 million that matured. We have another tranche of debt of $100 million that is maturing in July, and we expect that to pay that on maturity. So we currently have very strong financial flexibility. As a result of the merger, Fitch ratings placed Agnico's BBB rating on positive outlook demonstrating that the merger has further strengthened Technical's balance sheet.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All right. I don't talk to debt agencies very often. They don't study upside. How can the debt rating be only BBB whenever the net debt is almost nothing. And there's $3 billion of EBITDA and not a lot of interest expense. And you don't have a lot of specific risks. You don't have to solve problems in PNG and enza and the Lupita like Mark Briscoe, -- what -- why do you bother paying for these bond ratings. So they look like they're 2 paper...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, so I'm not an expert in bond ratings, but I think part of it also has to do with the inherent risky nature of the mining business. We did -- I mean, as a result of the merger with Cowen we merged with Kirkland Lake, they had a significant amount of cash, 0 debt. So we're net debt position to get better with the merger, which is why we've put on a positive rating outlook, but it does take them time to readjust their credit ratings. But we do this -- we get the debt rating, the credit ratings in order to get flexibility in terms of if we ever decide to issue public debt.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Can you to make a bid on Yamana [ph] go out and have a spending spree for one sort or another. I'm kidding you are...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Aurea Dela Resma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Definitely not something Agnico would do. But yes, it's for added flexibility really is what it is.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So as mentioned, we're in a strong financial position. So this strong financial position allows us to continue to provide returns to shareholders. Our objective is to provide a sustainable dividend that can grow over time. So as previously mentioned, this year marks the 39th consecutive year of dividends paid and historically, we paid over $2 billion in cumulative dividends.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We view the dividend as an important component, and we have a competitive yield relative to our peers. In February, we announced our first share buyback in the amount of $5.2 million. We see the share buyback as the variable piece in our shareholder return policy, while the objective for the dividend is to be able to pay a sustainable dividend even in a lower gold price environment. We want to avoid a situation where we have to decrease the dividend. And so we see the share buybacks as a variable portion of our capital returns.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So just to summarize, we remain committed to our mission, which is to build a high-quality easy-to-understand business, one that generates superior long-term returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees and contribute positively to the communities and countries in which we operate. We have a simple, consistent, disciplined and proven approach to value creation. Agnico has earned a reputation as a partner of choice within our industry of being reliable operating with respect for others for building trust and sharing opportunities with all our stakeholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Everywhere we operate and strive to be an admired member of the community and to be recognized as both a good employer and a good neighbor. We believe that in order for mining to work and his work for all stakeholders. We believe that environmental, social and governance considerations are not a burden, but an opportunity to improve our performance and sustain our business over the long term. We will benefit from the combined expertise technical expertise and exploration expertise of our teams and the strong regional focus in some of our -- some of the best mining jurisdictions in the world.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We will benefit from our merged financial strength and our extensive pipeline of development and exploration projects to drive future growth. Lastly, we will continue to build on our long history of returning capital to shareholders. Agnico has paid a dividend since 1983. And as previously mentioned, we announced our first share buyback that was initiated this quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We truly believe we are bringing together the best people, the highest-quality reserves and industry leader can ship in sustainability to build and grow our business for generation to cost. So that concludes my formal presentation. I'll open it up to you, John, for any further questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Q - John Tumazos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure, sure. There is, of course, the function for the audience to submit questions through the question box - so I really want to applaud the absence of business policy changes at the outset of the merger. And nothing is being destroyed in human capital and projects are being preserved.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So area as I read the appendices to the slides, it seems like there could be a 1 million ounce increase in production from existing assets even with the depletion of the Mort by 2027 in the little mines like India and Pinesonos and Goldex maybe being less than 10-year projects.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So there's all these exploration in JVs and investments, white gold, which speaks to 1215. -- or Rupert that we host a sale GoldQuest, Orla, Rian Wallbridge that we host, Maple Gold that we host, Cardiepro Catalyst.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Then we've got these 5 big projects that add up to almost 1 million ounces, opaperBemfer amoneaniTrudis, Odyssey Ranaldi extensions. And of course, Odyssey and East Goolewill pretty much replace the omarit. So - how are you going to keep production down to 3.3 million ounces...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Aurea Dela Resma</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, while we have a lot of pipeline projects and development opportunities, we are looking to stage our capital spending. So we're not looking to just grow as big or as fast as we can. We're looking to keep capital spending levels in the $1.3 billion range. Half of that would be -- sustaining half of that would be growth. So we would be staging our growth capital, and we wouldn't be building all of these opportunities at the same time.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At the same time, the timing of all of these opportunities are not necessarily all aligned at the same time as well. So our objective is not to be the biggest. It's sort of to run a sustainable, stable business and our focus is on growing per share value for the shareholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Tumazos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Of all these different projects that him and Reef, the only one that's $1 billion magnitude or maybe Hammond Reef plus the Malartic underground, but the 2 partners will share the alerted capital?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Aurea Dela Resma</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Those are the big ones. A lot of our projects are brownfield projects that are near mine site and add existing infrastructure so that we wouldn't expect them to be large capital outlays. So you're correct that those are the 2 big points.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Tumazos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In your investments, Walbridge and Maple are a little north, not really on the main drag.

There are some -- with Agnico doing to remove political barriers to using gold and commerce such as treating U.S. cold Eagle coins as property instead legal tender money face amounts of the coin provided by U.S. law. I guess somebody wants to turn the U.S. into the gold standard. They think Sean and Mario...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Aurea Dela Resma</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes.

We don't hold it for opportunistic purposes, and we also don't hedge any of our goals. So we'll continue with that policy. We, of course, do have a little bit of gold inventory in terms of like for example, we -- if we had -- in Nunavut, we have sort of a golden up shock that will hold. I think very small amount of ounces, nothing material that we would actually hole sell all our ounces...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Tumazos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sorry, there's a phenomenon in the silver market where silver bars and silver coins and private transactions in the U.S., seem to sell for 10% to 50% more than Comex prices. There are advertisements to buy bars and coins by dealers, 10%, 20% over market -- do you ever second guess the market price? There's some evidence that silver price on the exchange doesn't reflect the market or in other markets, Orean aluminum, there's a $0.30 to $0.40 Midwest premium. In the nickel market, there's premium for purity.

So we -- I mean we don't change who we sell our goal too. We'll sell them to the banks, and it is at the market price. We accept in our industry that we're price takers.

So the project metrics remain the same. But as you mentioned, yes, there could be some adjustments to inflation, that kind of thing. At this point, it's really just a fit on where it would be in the sort of production profile. And given that when we just merged with Kirkland Lake pool, there's still a lot of assets that we need to evaluate at this point...</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Aurea Dela Resma</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of the -- two Nunavut producing mines, Amaruq and Meliadine. It's quite commendable that the costs haven't changed a lot this year given the escalation in energy prices. How long does it take the oil price to work into your cost structure, given that you buy oil and maybe you ship seasonally and you have some hedging. So is there a 6- to 12-month lag in your northern operations between the spot oil price and your cash cost.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Tumazos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. So we do barge all of our fuel that's required for the next year in the July, August season of the prior year, so there is a 1-year lag. So this coming July, August will be our next season to send up any of the diesel that we need for our Nunavut operations. We are about 40% hedged on fuel for upcoming purchases in the year.

So it wouldn't necessarily need to be there in terms of a resource that we currently see, but we would have to see that there's a potential to be there for decades. We don't go to countries to just operate one mine. It's to operate several mines, and we want to be there for decades.

As mentioned this year, we're expecting closer to the $60 million range in terms of synergies. Most of that relates to the corporate synergy side. G&amp;A, it's a lot easier to reduce a lot of that. First, on the operations side, that takes a little bit more of a lead time. We could see an impact of about $10 an ounce this year. And then going forward, we're looking at a run rate of about $130 million per year. In terms of capital spending, that's on the projects, we're still -- most of that -- most of the capital spending will relate to our strategic optimization, which would be Upper Beaver for the 8-K deposit. And those 2 opportunities are still currently being evaluated, so we don't have a solid capital spending number yet on those.

And as I mentioned, that we're looking at a 28 million ton per annum mining scenario there. We're expecting to provide the results of that study with the Q2 results that are coming out in July. So that's the big one. We are doing some not necessarily in technical studies, but internal evaluations. I did mention Upper Beaver is one of them. We're looking closer at the 8-K deposit.

Good question about why don't these companies capture the premiums being paid for gold by consumers.. $<a href="/symbol/AMRK" title="A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc." sasource="comment">AMRK</a> is making huge profits on the spread between spot and retail gold buying.
