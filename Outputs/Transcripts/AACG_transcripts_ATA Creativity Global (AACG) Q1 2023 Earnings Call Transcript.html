Good evening to those in America. We appreciate everyone’s time. 2023, we got up to a soft start of ACG, we still do kind of teaching staff back in the classroom across our 21 training centers nationwide.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We were pleased to report our 10% increase in student enrollments during the first quarter, which was driven by a notable increase in portfolio training student.

Gross margin was 44.3% during the first quarter 2023 compared to 45.7% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the increased cost of service related to higher compensation expenses incurred for certain teaching staff or engaged in the enhanced efficiency and the quality of service delivery, an initiative that began in the second quarter of 2022.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss attribute to ACG was RMB17.8 million during first quarters 2023 compared to RMB15.9 million in the prior-year period, which was preliminary result of increased sales expenses related to performance bonuses awarded in line with enrollment growth during the period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving to the balance sheet.

We are delighted to welcome all of our students back in person at our training centers the start of 2023. There is a pandemic largely behind us, we were pleased to have achieved such strong enrollment being driven by our core portfolio training service business, resulting in consistent revenues for the quarter driven by the portfolio training and overseas study counselling services, have managed students preparing to apply for overseas education, since many countries including China have relaxed travel restrictions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">They recently launched with long-term [ph] strategy, introducing a new contemporary logo and motto "Beyond the Differences" they believe these new elements try to reflect our goal of helping students find the courage and the determination to be their authentic selves and embrace original thought and expression.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we think today students will identify with our philosophy and approach to creative education. If you pride yourself on being an innovatible and forward thinking organization, and we hope to instill in our students allow for creativity and sharing of ideas among the different peoples from different places and life circumstances.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Enrollment during first quarter 2023, appear to mark the start of a positive trend within our research-based learning services business, as many students have financial for our various overseas camps they had plan for this summer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This program of overseas student college run [Indiscernible] in the summer season.

Mr. Sima. We're honored to have served so many students who have remained committed to the creative service education during the past few challenging years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our goal during this time has been to continue providing a quality curriculum, access and support from teachers and staff, guiding them from start to finish on a competitive portfolio, and then reaching their education with hands on art related experiences.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our hope is that all of this will eventually culminate in a student having a well rounded education and experience that would set them apart from others who are applying for school.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe a track record of positive student outcomes sets us apart from the competition, and we expect to be on the current momentum and continue to grow our business by providing superior art education experiences to our students.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">ACG have continued to offer immersive research based learning projects. We're excited about overseas summer camps we're currently enrolling students in. one of the projects is a summer school at University of the Arts London, all participating students will be able to take courses designed for each stage of the art study on a UL campus and immediately engaged in an English speaking environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're also offering a future of design exploration work and hosted in the Netherlands and Denmark, through which students will learn about the current and future design trends and be exposed to the interdisciplinary methodologies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The goal is for students to independently create a design proposal. Students who participate in this project will receive certificates of completion at the end of the camps, and one-on-one study opportunities with some of the greatest minds in a particular areas of creative arts.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're very excited to be offering this summer programs this year, and cannot wait to hear from students about their experiences.

We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Alice Zhang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As we wait for questions to queue, I received some questions via email from William Gregozeski from Greenridge Global that I would like to post to the management team. I'll start with this one. Was there any COVID related impact on the first quarter numbers? Or is it a true reflection of the period?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Ruobai Sima </span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. I think, yes, of course, I think [Indiscernible] during the -- after the COVID period. But maybe for one figure, I think for the sales volume, I think, which is very directly reflected. But I think it will continue -- I think compare for the last -- for the same quarter last year, I think we have taken a very great increase. And maybe the total sales is around RMB50 million and to around RMB80 million. But also we come here with the same figure and this is for the same period in 2019, I mean, the period before the COVID-19 occurred. And I think we also take a very big increase that from it. The total sales volume increase from RMB60 million to RMB90 million. I think this average means that this increase is not only from the COVID impact, but its also from some natural increase. Beside of these, I think we notice that this increase is not similar increase from enrollment numbers, but also inputs about the unit [ph] price. So in that way, I think that figure can reflect the real situation of increase during the period of the year. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Alice Zhang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Mr. Sima for the answer. The second question I have is, can we expect to see student enrollment and credit hours increase on a year-on-year basis for the remainder of 2023?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Ruobai Sima </span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. I think we hope that this trend can be continued. I think our portfolio got bigger and bigger. And currently we still believe that its increase over key business -- their increase trend on the following is positive.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Alice Zhang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. Appreciate the answer. One last question from Bill is, where do you think you need to be in terms of enrollment or credit hours to reach profitability? And do you have the cash to get there?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Ruobai Sima </span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think in order to get probability is not as simple question here to just simply and increase enrollment or credit hours. I think, of course, and for the marketing side, I think that our sales volume increase is a one way and beside of these and we also try to develop more new business lines, and also we have made our pricing methodology more closer to the class of marketing, situation changes. And beside of these maybe will also focus on our internal controls. I think we've made our operating and more efficiency, and we'll focus on cost controls and the teaching management and more efficient, and I think in that way we can enhance our operating efficiencies. By those approaches, I think we're going to make our cash management balance and exactly I think we can gather data and to make our probability. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Alice Zhang</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great, thank you. That's all the questions from Bill. I'll hand it back to the main Q&amp;A session now. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor over to Mr. Sima, CFO for closing comments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ruobai Sima</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks again to all of you for joining us. If anyone have questions for us, please feel free to reach out directly to us or our investor relation form the faculty group.
