Dan?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Daniel Peed</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Thanks Karin. Hello, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. I'm Dan Peed, Chairman and CEO of<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> UPC Insurance. I'm planning to offer an overview of some of our activities and then Brad Martz will provide for more specific numbers.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Results in the third quarter continue to highlight the performance difference between our personal lines and commercial lines businesses. Please see page five of our investor supplements for more information.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Personal lines was disappointing with a core loss of $69.8 million. Key factors include the loss of the UPC Insurance Company's financial stability rating issued by Demotech and the downgrade of UPC Insurance Company's Kroll rating. These impact our renewal retention levels and therefore, gross written premium and grow starting premium.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Another significant factor was our increased reinsurance spend coming out of our 61 cat placement, which therefore increases seeded on premium and decreases net earned premium faster than the exposures are decreasing. While current accident year non-cat losses are down, the decrease in earned premium outpaces the decrease in losses driving the poor result. This is compounded by significant strengthening of our prior year reserves reflecting an increased claims severity driven by inflation and the excessive Florida litigation on prior year losses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">These results have driven the write-down of our DTA, large valuation allowance in the second quarter and in the third quarter, we wrote down approximately $13.6 million with goodwill against our personal lines operations.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In personal lines, we continue to downsize the portfolio with total policies in force down about 36% since the beginning of 2022, and total return values down 34.6%. We also continue to drive rate with an average of 20.4% rate increase and an average 35% rate lift when combining rate plus increased insurance to value.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In commercial lines written in American Coastal Insurance Company, our business continues to grow with net premium earned larger than the personal lines net earned premium $59.5 million. Results are strong with a profit for the third quarter despite Hurricane Ian losses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Core income of $1.8 million for the third quarter and $32 million year-to-date demonstrate the earnings power of the commercial lines book. The underlying combined ratio was 57.6% for the quarter and 66.1% year-to-date.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In anticipation of increasing our cat reinsurance costs. We are achieving strong rate increases averaging over 30% and 3Q, improving insurance to value, improving terms, and reducing P&amp;L exposure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We also experienced favorable prior year development of $1.8 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million year-to-date for our commercial lives business. Given the loss of the Demotech Financial Stability Rating and UPC Insurance Company, and the very different outcomes between our personal lines and commercial lines businesses, in the third quarter, we decided to put our core personal lines businesses into runoff.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To accomplish this, we filed plans of withdrawal in Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. These plans have been approved by the regulators in each state and will generally result in non-renewals of personal lines policies beginning as early as November 1st in Texas, and as late as January 1st, 2023 in Florida and Louisiana.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In New York, we are continuing to non-renew in UPC and offer renewals and Interborough Insurance Company. Interborough and American Coastal both retaining physically financial strength ratings and both Kroll and Demotech. As previously announced, we continue to evaluate integral options to divest from all personal loans.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In summary, our third quarter reflected lots of change. we continue to de risk the personal lines portfolio, which drives a headwind of decrease in net earned premium. A disappointing core loss for the quarter is due to poor performance in our personal lines business reflecting loss of UPC Insurance Company's financial stability ratings, increased reinsurance spend, significant prior year development, and a write off of goodwill in our personal lines company.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our commercial lines business continues to perform well with a profit in the quarter despite one of the worst hurricanes to hit Florida in recent history. We expect the Florida market to remain hard for the foreseeable future, due to a skeptical and hard capital and reinsurance market, recently elevated catastrophe activity and continued headwinds created by excessive Florida litigation levels.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I'll turn it over to Brad Martz.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Bennett Martz</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Dan. And hello, this is Brad marks the President and CFO of UPC insurance. I'm pleased to review UPCS financial results, but also encourage everyone to review our press release, investor presentation, and Form 10-Q for more information regarding the company's performance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Highlights for the quarter ending September 30th, 2022 included a GAAP net loss of $70.9 million or $1.65 a share compared to a net loss of $14.3 million or $0.33 a share last year. Our core loss of $57.5 million or $1.34 a share compared to a core loss of $15.5 million or $0.36 a share a year ago.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On page four of our investor presentation highlights that our core loss included $37.4 million of net retained cat losses in the current accident year and $44.6 million of prior year reserve development. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our cat losses were driven by Hurricane Ian, which included a $16.4 million net retention by American Coastal and United Property &amp; Casualty plus a $20.1 million loss incurred by our captive EPC REIT. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The additional retention by our captive was due to UPC REIT replacing one reinsure on a $25 million excess of $20 million layer of the core cat program, who elected determinate their participation upon UPC's downgrade by Demotech during the third quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The $20.1 million retained loss excludes the return on reinsurance premium of roughly $15 million, so the net economic impact between losses and seeded premiums was around $5 million related to the captive's participation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Prior year reserved development of $44.6 million resulted from a reallocation of IBNR from current accident year to prior accident years in our personal line segment. Higher loss severity continued to cause older accent ears to perform worse than expected, but our outlook for the current accident your loss ratio improved during the quarter. As Dan mentioned, commercial lines actually had favorable development in the current period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross premiums written for the quarter of $255.2 million declined $67.3 million or approximately 21%. And gross premiums earned of $301.9 million decreased about 15%. Pages nine through 11 of our investor presentation continue to demonstrate that we're getting significantly more rate in both personal lines and commercial lines relative to our exposure base.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Seeded earned premiums were $185.7 million comparing favorably to $200.2 million last year, due to our lower exposure base and the reduction of our quota share sessions session rates from 23% to 18% at June 1st.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Other items included in total revenues during the current quarter were net investment income of $4.3 million, which increased approximately 23% due to higher yields and net unrealized losses from equity securities of $2.5 million which were about $775,000 lower than the prior year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">UPC's third quarter net loss and loss adjustment expense was $117.2 million, an increase of $14.5 million or 14% year-over-year. The current accident year catastrophe losses added over 32 points to our net loss and combined ratios. With the impact of prior year reserve development adding 38 points on the same ratios.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our underlying loss and LAE was $35.2 million, down $28.6 million or 45% year over year, due in large part to the reallocation of IBNR to prior accident years. This produced an underlying net loss ratio of 30.3%, which improved over 11 points compared to the third quarter last year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Page five of our investor presentation summarizes our results by line of business and as Dan mentioned, continues to show profitable results for commercial lines inclusive of the significant loss related to Hurricane Ian, and is exactly why we're determined to focus exclusively on the segment going forward.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Page six of our investor presentation highlights the impact Hurricane Ian had on our core catastrophe reinsurance program. Here you will see red dotted lines showing where Hurricane Ian is estimated to be in the Florida hurricane catastrophe funds specific to each American Coastal and United Property &amp; Casualty, as well as the utilization of private open market limit shared by and allocated to American Coastal and United P&amp;C. Our personal lines loss is estimated near the top of the United P&amp;Cs program, leaving only $63.4 million of limit from the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund. And about 9.3 million from private reinsurers remaining.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our commercial lines loss is much lower and we estimate American Coastal has approximately $818 million of limit remaining. After reinstatement premiums of $15.4 million, we have approximately $1.4 billion of aggregate limit remaining after Hurricane Ian, but the majority of that protection is specific to American Coastal's Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Given our [Indiscernible] participation on the underlying $25 million in excess of $20 million layer, our expected retention now from a second event is estimated at $31.8 million for the group. Hurricane Ian created new uncertainty related to the viability of our previously announced runoff plan for United Property &amp; Casualty and is clearly a significant risk factor going forward.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Management continues to work closely with its regulators and monitor developments, as well as adjust our runoff plan as needed or required.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">UPC's operating expenses were $75 million, a decrease of $1.3 million or 2% year over year. This decline was driven mainly by lower acquisition costs from agent commission reductions in our personal and business. However, this was offset in the G&amp;A expense line due to the amortization of the $13.6 million goodwill charge related to impairment of goodwill on our personal lines segment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Page seven of our investor presentation includes balance sheet highlights to help reconcile some of the significant changes this period. GAAP equity attributable to UHC stockholders declined to $80.4 million with a book value per share of $1.86.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Rising interest rates led to valuation declines in our fixed income portfolio and this combined with unrealized losses drove accumulated other comprehensive loss of $60. -- $64.8 million, which impacted the value per share by approximately $1.50 per share.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And finally, statutory policyholder surplus for the group at the end of the third quarter is currently estimated to be approximately $170 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your continued interest in UPC and that concludes today's call.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>End of Q&amp;A</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. That does conclude our call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you again for your participation.</p></div><div class="above_now_read-piano-placeholder"></div><div><ul><li class="jc_E0"

The holding company's main sources of capital are American Coastal and Interboro, mostly the former.

The company has no plans to take the actual losses at this time though (see the latest 10Q)<br>4) ACIC/Interboro re-insurance pricing for 6/1/23 could end up much higher than expected, further compressing margins at ACIC, but mgt has and continues to take aggressive pricing actions<br>5) If interest rates back up further, charges to AOCI will reduce the company's book value<p class="txt-sep"></p>If the company makes it through the end of 2023 without triggering one or more of these risks, ACIC/Interboro should exit 2023 with statutory surplus of almost $135 mm (pro forma $90 mm number listed above plus a little less than $45 mm in after-tax net).   In my opinion, the commercial-lines business should generate roughly $45 mm in 2024 operating income (pricing/re-insurance costs/policy count are obviously critical to $45 mm assumption).   Given the high returns on capital at the commercial-lines sub, I suspect the market will accord that operating income a healthy multiple (for an insurance company).</div><div class="AJ_OF r_Z r_3"><button aria-label="Reply to Dynamic_Value_Investor" class="J_eB r_0 r_1 r_6 AJ_0T s_dB" data-test-id="reply-button" type="button"><span class=""><svg viewBox="0 0 18 13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="AJ_0U"><path d="m11.33 13-.01-4.16h-.11c-.08 0-.2 0-.35-.02a14.09 14.09 0 0 1-5.12-1.34 9.78 9.78 0 0 1-3.88-3.21 9.68 9.68 0 0 1-.92-1.68C.46 1.59 0 0 0 0l2.11 1.72c2.1 1.71 4.86 2.39 9.21 2.46V0L18 6.5 11.33 13zm1.5-5.67v2.1l3.02-2.93-3.02-2.95v2.12h-1.5c-2.87 0-5.29-.38-7.25-1.12a8.5 8.5 0 0 0 2.31 1.58 12.87 12.87 0 0 0 4.86 1.2h1.58z"></path></svg><span class="AJ_0V s_cC">Reply</span></span></button><button aria-label="Like comment" class="ur_CG AJ_0S r_Z r_3 ur_Vs" data-test-id="like-button" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 19 16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="ur_fw"><path d="M17.8 7.18h-2.69V15h2.69zm-4.86 6.4s.1 1.32-1.34 1.32H4.26s-1.86-2.13-3.2-6.7C.64 6.78 2.7 6.57 2.7 6.57h5.17S5.9 4.04 5.7 2.21C5.5.38 7.26.69 8.39 2.71c1.14 2.04 4.55 3.86 4.55 3.86v7z"></path></svg><span class="ur_hG">Like</span></button></div></div></div></div><div class="" data-test-id="comment"><div class="yJ_L6 qH_Qh qH_Le r_Z s_ay s_bC"><div class="yJ_Fc s_dn" data-test-id="comment-user-pic"><div class="flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center relative w-36 h-36 rounded-full" data-test-id="user-pic-wrapper"><div class="flex h-full w-full shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-black-20 uppercase text-white" data-test-id="user-pic"><span>M</span></div></div></div><div class="yJ_vz r_ak"><div class="yJ_I r_Z r_ah s_d4"><div class="yJ_KJ r_Z r_1 r_9 s_dW"><a class="yJ_Fd" data-test-id="comment-author-nick" rel="nofollow" href="/user/52522007">Marne1914</a><div class="AH_eI r_Z r_1 bb_jE bb_jT bb_j9"><span data-test-id="comment-date"><span class="AH_wP">11 Jan. 2023, 4:27 PM</span></span><button aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Comment options" class="flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center text-large-r text-black-35 dark:text-black-10 AH_rd" data-test-id="dropdown" type="button"><span class="truncate"><span class="AH_JP r_Z s_cM"><svg class="AH_Jg"><use xlink:href="#info"></use></svg></span></span></button></div></div><div class="yJ_Zt r_Z r_ah s_b0 bb_jE bb_jT bb_j9"><div class="yJ_Zu s_au"><div class="BV_a q_V"><a class="" href="/premium?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Acomments%7Csection_asset%3Abadge%7Cbutton%3APremium"><span class="gj_rl r_0 r_1 r_6 gj_oX s_aq s_bu s_aO s_bb bb_jC bb_jR bb_ka gj_nA BV_rl s_dh s_dW s_ar s_bv s_aO s_bb" data-test-id="status-badge"><span>Premium</span></span></a></div></div><div class="yJ_Zv s_au r_Z r_9"><div class="yJ_ZC r_Z r_1"><a class="yJ_F5" data-test-id="comment-count" href="/user/52522007#comments">Comments (34)</a></div></div></div></div><div class="yJ_f s_d4" data-test-id="comment-content"><a href="/author/timothy-stabosz" class="usertag">@Timothy Stabosz</a> From looking across the companies that have insurance business in Florida it seems as if there has been a sea-change. UIHC continues up day after day. HRTG continues to move up. The legislation that was passed appears to have been an absolute game changer for these companies and the prices are starting to reflect that reality. Admittedly, I am a tourist when it comes to the insurance business. In your opinion, which company is the cleanest to play this trend? I am leaning towards HRTG but UIHC seems to have more torque to it. Any insight would be appreciated.</div><div class="AJ_OF r_Z r_3"><button aria-label="Reply to Marne1914" class="J_eB r_0 r_1 r_6 AJ_0T s_dB" data-test-id="reply-button" type="button"><span class=""><svg viewBox="0 0 18 13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="AJ_0U"><path d="m11.33 13-.01-4.16h-.11c-.08 0-.2 0-.35-.02a14.09 14.09 0 0 1-5.12-1.34 9.78 9.78 0 0 1-3.88-3.21 9.68 9.68 0 0 1-.92-1.68C.46 1.59 0 0 0 0l2.11 1.72c2.1 1.71 4.86 2.39 9.21 2.46V0L18 6.5 11.33 13zm1.5-5.67v2.1l3.02-2.93-3.02-2.95v2.12h-1.5c-2.87 0-5.29-.38-7.25-1.12a8.5 8.5 0 0 0 2.31 1.58 12.87 12.87 0 0 0 4.86 1.2h1.58z"></path></svg><span class="AJ_0V s_cC">Reply</span></span></button><button aria-label="Like comment" class="ur_CG AJ_0S r_Z r_3 ur_Vs" data-test-id="like-button" type="button"><svg viewBox="0 0 19 16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="ur_fw"><path d="M17.8 7.18h-2.69V15h2.69zm-4.86 6.4s.1 1.32-1.34 1.32H4.26s-1.86-2.13-3.2-6.7C.64 6.78 2.7 6.57 2.7 6.57h5.17S5.9 4.04 5.7 2.21C5.5.38 7.26.69 8.39 2.71c1.14 2.04 4.55 3.86 4.55 3.86v7z"></path></svg><span class="ur_hG">Like</span></button></div></div></div></div><div class="" data-test-id="comment"><div class="yJ_L6 qH_Qh qH_Le r_Z s_ay s_bC"><div class="yJ_Fc s_dn" data-test-id="comment-user-pic"><div class="flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center relative w-36 h-36 rounded-full" data-test-id="user-pic-wrapper"><div class="flex h-full w-full shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-black-20 uppercase text-white" data-test-id="user-pic"><span>D</span></div></div></div><div class="yJ_vz r_ak"><div class="yJ_I r_Z r_ah s_d4"><div class="yJ_KJ r_Z r_1 r_9 s_dW"><a class="yJ_Fd" data-test-id="comment-author-nick" rel="nofollow" href="/user/10708751">Dynamic_Value_Investor</a><div class="AH_eI r_Z r_1 bb_jE bb_jT bb_j9"><span data-test-id="comment-date"><span class="AH_wP">11 Jan. 2023, 4:36 PM</span></span><button aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Comment options" class="flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center text-large-r text-black-35 dark:text-black-10 AH_rd" data-test-id="dropdown" type="button"><span class="truncate"><span class="AH_JP r_Z s_cM"><svg class="AH_Jg"><use xlink:href="#info"></use></svg></span></span></button></div></div><div class="yJ_Zt r_Z r_ah s_b0 bb_jE bb_jT bb_j9"><div class="yJ_Zu s_au"><div class="BV_a q_V"><a class="" href="/premium?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Acomments%7Csection_asset%3Abadge%7Cbutton%3APremium"><span class="gj_rl r_0 r_1 r_6 gj_oX s_aq s_bu s_aO s_bb bb_jC bb_jR bb_ka gj_nA BV_rl s_dh s_dW s_ar s_bv s_aO s_bb" data-test-id="status-badge"><span>Premium</span></span></a></div></div><div class="yJ_Zv s_au r_Z r_9"><div class="yJ_ZC r_Z r_1"><a class="yJ_F5" data-test-id="comment-count" href="/user/10708751#comments">Comments (2.14K)</a></div></div></div></div><div class="yJ_f s_d4" data-test-id="comment-content"><a href="/user/52522007" rel="nofollow" class="usertag">@Marne1914</a> <p class="txt-sep"></p>If you want to benefit from recent AOB reform, you want residential exposure - that's HRTG.   <p class="txt-sep"></p>If you want to benefit from the shuttering of a terribly unprofitable business line, you want to own UIHC.

One of my worst outcomes over the past 30 years of investing.  Truly sickening, considering insiders loved the stock a year ago.   Not selling at these prices, primarily because of the value of the commercial biz, but really have no confidence whatsoever that further current, and prior period, personal lines  losses will not overwhelm any remaining value and wipe out shareholders.<p class="txt-sep"></p>Arguably the most savage and ignominious  destruction of shareholder value, in the shortest period of time, I have EVER seen, in over 30 years of professional investing. <p class="txt-sep"></p>Peed’s reference to a “disappointing” quarter is truly misplaced.   But I guess i can’t expect a CEO to use more accurate terms like “devastating,” “ravaging,””decimating,” “annihilating,” or “sickening swoon.”<p class="txt-sep"></p>This is going to be the destruction of his professional reputation, specific to the P&amp;C insurance biz, anyway, unfortunately for him, if he does not salvage material value for shareholders.<p class="txt-sep"></p>Make no mistake.  The destruction of this company’s shareholders’ investment has been nothing short of BREATHTAKINGLY DEVASTATING.<p class="txt-sep"></p>And then, to top it off, these weenies don’t take any questions.
