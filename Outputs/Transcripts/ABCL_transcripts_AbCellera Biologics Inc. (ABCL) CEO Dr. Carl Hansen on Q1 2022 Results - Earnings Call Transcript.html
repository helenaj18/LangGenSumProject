It's my pleasure to provide an update in our business for the first quarter of 2022. Given the current market environment more than ever, a strong balance sheet is critical. We ended the quarter with over $780 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a result, we are ideally positioned to continue executing on our long-term strategy. Our strategy is to invest aggressively in our technologies, workforce and infrastructure to establish the dominant competitive advantage in the invention and creation of therapeutic antibodies. And then to use this capability to build a large and diversified portfolio that is going long in the next generation of antibody drugs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our investments are focused on three priorities; first, building technology and infrastructure to create a centralized engine for the discovery and development of antibody therapeutics at scale; second, executing on partner programs to build a diversified portfolio of stakes in next generation therapeutic antibodies; and third, technology development to unlock new target classes into enable new modalities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the past 10 years, Abcellera has been laser focused on this one thing, reinventing and rebuilding a new frontend for therapeutic antibody industry. Starting from a clean slate, we've replaced legacy platforms with new workflows that take full advantage of modern technologies from biology, engineering and computation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our vision is to establish a centralized discovery engine that integrates all steps from drug targets to IND at greater speed, the highest quality, and at much greater scale than it's ever been achieved before. This strategy will only work if it is done at scale. After a decade of work, we believe it is now inevitable that we will achieve our vision, and we also believe that there is no other company that will be able to catch up.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We estimate that by the end of 2022, we will have invested more than $0.5 dollars in building our capabilities. And we expect to have more than doubled this before the end of 2025. These investments which have been made in our technology, our workforce and our infrastructure, have given us a definitive technology advantage and we've established a new technology curve that we believe is now accelerating.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We expect our technology advantage will continue to grow as we fully integrate our capabilities. This quarter, our teams achieved major milestones in the development and integration of high throughput workflows for mid- to late-stage preclinical lead assessment and development. These capabilities are now being deployed to accelerate meet optimization and IND enabling studies with our partners.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're also investing in our infrastructure to scale our business and our R&amp;D efforts. This past quarter we brought online three new facilities with lab and office space including facilities in Sydney, Australia; the UK; and Vancouver, Canada. With future expansion in our GMP facility, we expect to have more than 650,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities in place by the end of 2025.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the business of innovation, the most important factor for success is a high performance workforce. We continue to invest in building and training our team, which has roughly doubled since this time, last year. Importantly, over two-thirds of our R&amp;D team is building, integrating and scaling our technologies to extend our competitive advantage, with the other third focused on partner programs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Unlike conventional biotech companies, we have made software development, a pillar of our technology strategy. As of now, we have over 25% of our R&amp;D team dedicated to software development, data science and machine learning. We believe the seamless integration of experimental capabilities with software development and data science is essential to achieving scale and to mastering the complexity of antibody discovery.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our second area of focus is building our portfolio. Today, we have 158 programs under contract, with 133 that have downstream participation. These programs address indications that span a broad range of therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology and immunology. As noted in our last earnings call, our success in business development last year has entering 2022 with a strong book of work.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Accordingly, this year, we anticipate fewer multi-year, multi-target agreements and we are prioritizing deals with greater downstream participation or that we view as having greater strategic value. In line with this, we have recently announced the expansion of our existing partnership within Empirico, a company that is using complication and human genetics data to identify and validate new drug targets.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition to increasing the number of targets from five to seven, this new agreement provides Abcellera with the option on a program-by-program basis to co-invest in preclinical and clinical development in exchange for a greater ownership stake in each program. These new terms will apply to a first program that was started under the original agreement. This program, which is against an undisclosed GPCR target has produced several potent functional antibodies and has now advanced in vivo studies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Going from start to in vivo studies and under 12 months on a difficult target exemplifies the speed of our technologies. It also shows how partnering with Abcellera can level the plain field for smaller companies. Similar to our previous announcements with EQRx, this deal structure has the potential to create a series of programs in which we have a greater ownership position, which could be up to 50%. These types of deals are aligned with our long-term strategy to build a portfolio that is diversified across indications, partner type, modality and deal structure. We believe this diversification can be effectively used to achieve strong economic returns, while at the same time avoiding the binary risk that is typically associated with biotech.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving on, I would now like to highlight swift progress that we have made in applying our technology to unlock next generation modalities. Specifically, I'm excited to update you on our progress in building a panel of CD3-binding antibodies for next generation T-cell engagers. We first announced this effort in November of last year. For those unfamiliar with the modality, T-cell engagers are a class of new cancer treatments designed to help the immune system recognize and kill cancer. They can be used alone or in combination of other cancer treatments, such as checkpoint inhibitors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">T-cell engages are bispecific antibodies that simultaneously bind to CD3, a receptor on T-cells and a specific tumor antigen. The success of these therapies is critically dependent on finding the right CD three antibodies. However, because CD3 in notoriously difficult target, there have been very few antibodies available, forcing drug developers to reuse the same suboptimal CD3 antibodies. This challenge is compounded by the fact that, technology for manufacturing bispecifics is also not widely available, forcing drug developers to further compromise on the design of their therapies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To solve these problems, we applied our technology to build what we believe is now the largest panel of diverse, high quality, fully human CD3 antibodies available. We recently presented this work at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. This panel includes hundreds of unique antibodies has a broad range of functional activity and covers a large diversity of binding sites.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe it opens the door to fine tuning T-cell activation in a way that is specific to each tumor antigens. That should enable the design of therapies that achieved the correct therapeutic window and has the potential to extend the use of T-cell engagers to a broader range of cancers, including solid tumors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are now actively working to demonstrate this application with a number of different tumor antigens. Following AACR meeting, we have seen strong interest in partners and we are exploring opportunities to bring these forward with our programs -- pardon me, are exploring opportunities to bring these forward into their programs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And with that, I'll hand off to Andrew Booth, our CFO to provide an overview of our first quarter 2022 financials.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Andrew Booth</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Carl. I'm pleased to highlight the progress we've made on our key business metrics beginning with our program starts. We started six new programs in the first quarter of 2022. Taking this to a cumulative number of 84 programs starts. And while the rate of starts will continue to be somewhat irregular, we expect that generally increasing trend year-over-year as we have seen in the recent past.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This is particularly true for the last year, we've started 30 programs in the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2022, compared to 7 programs and the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021. We ended the quarter with two new programs under contract with 36 unique partners. That is a 33% increase in programs under contract as compared to the end of Q1 in 2021. As we noted on a previous earnings call, with our total of 158 programs under contract, we have a strong look of work.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our business development focuses on the high quality programs that are a complement to our existing partnerships and where we have a strong economic position for AbCellera. As we have indicated previously, total programs under contract is a leading indicator of the longer term trajectory expected for program starts. Also in Q1 2022, our partners advanced one more molecule into the clinic, bringing our total molecules in the clinic to sixth at the end of the first quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We view this growing list of molecules in the clinic as specific examples of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term. The emergency use authorization of bamlanivimab and the current U.S. government purchase order in the first quarter contributed meaningfully to our Q1 results.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As mentioned on the prior slide, in the first quarter, we also had another molecule receive IND approval from the FDA. This molecule is from our Trianni licensing activity, and at the request of our partner, more details about this molecule are not available at this time. However, we would expect to be able to provide additional details on the future call as the molecule advances into clinical trials. We expect to see continued strong growth in these key drivers of the business and of shareholder value in the years ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to revenue. Revenue in the quarter was $317 million. The revenues were dominated by the $307 million of royalties we earn from shipments bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab during the first three months of the year. Research fees connected to our work on many programs, so the wide range of partners in Q1 2022 were $9 million, a meaningfully increase from the same quarter last year. This quarter licensing fees were minimal and we have no new milestone payments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead, we expect the majority of total 2022 revenue to be derived from royalties on COVID antibodies, really sold and shipped 600,000 doses of bamlanivimab to the U.S. government in the first quarter. The U.S. government retains an option to purchase a further 500,000 doses, which if the option were exercised would be shipped by July 31.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Lilly has stated that the exercise of this option by the U.S. government and any other future sales of bamlanivimab are uncertain, and they are currently guiding to know are only limited further COVID antibody revenue. As a reminder, under our agreement with Lilly for any COVID-19 products developed, we are eligible to receive royalties in the low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125 million and mid teens to mid 20s on aggregate sales above $125 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the first quarter, Lilly's sales of bamlanivimab far exceeded $125 million so that any future sales of the product are eligible for the same higher royalty rate that we had been earning on bebtelovimab. We continue to view COVID royalties as a no non--dilutive source of funding to support our investments and capacity and platform capabilities, including investments into forward integration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to operating expenses, our research and development expenses for the quarter were approximately $26 million, a $14 million increase over the previous year. The overall increase reflects our ongoing investments in R&amp;D, which will continue to grow as we expand our R&amp;D team's capabilities and capacity. This allows us to deliver our partner programs as well as to enhance our technology stack organically.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In sales and marketing, expenses for the quarter were approximately $2 million. In the same quarter in 2021, we had a non-recurring expense of nearly $1 million. This masks the growth of our business development team, capabilities, and reach, and explains the small reduction compared to Q1 in 2021.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">General and administration expenses for the quarter were approximately $14 million, compared to approximately 7 million in Q1 2021. About $4 million of this increase were related to hire non-cash stock based compensation expenses. The increase is otherwise driven by the need to support the growth of the business. We are reporting earnings of over $168 million for Q1 2022 compared to approximately $117 million in Q1 of 2021.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of earnings per share, this works out to an earnings of $0.59 per share on a basic and $0.54 on a diluted basis for the quarter. This result reflects the recognition of royalties on bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab and our ongoing investments to expand and enhance our discovery platform and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs, while running discovery efforts for our partners.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking at cash flows, operating cash flows, operating activities for the quarter contributed $100 million to cash flow, which includes the collection of the accrued accounts receivable balance from December 2021 that included royalties earned from bamlanivimab in the last quarter of 2021. The royalties from Q1 sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab are reflected in our acute accrued receivables balance of $326 million as of March 31.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the investing activity side, the quarter shows total investments of $26 million largely related to investments in property, plant and equipment. As a part of our treasury strategy, we continue to keep about $240 million invested in short-term marketable securities. As a result, we finished the quarter with over $780 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In summary, we remain in an increasingly strong liquidity position that allows us to execute on our strategy, continue to build capacity and to expand the platform. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity for well beyond the next three years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-And-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tiago Fauth with Credit Suisse. Tiago, your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Tiago Fauth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats back progress. So perhaps just using the Empirico experience as a comparison model, so, you actually have the option to co-develop some of these drugs. I'm assuming that's mostly going to be on the financial side to keep your ownership and not necessarily a potential pivot to developing internal drugs. But I guess the broader question is that, that seemed like a pretty unique structure and a pretty unique deal. Is that something that you see as you alluded to potentially becoming a little bit more selective in higher probability or higher quality partners or targets to the extent that it is possible? Is that a trend that you see for the near future and how do you balance that out relatively to getting a larger book of business, a more diversified book of business? Is that an actual trade-off or how do you see the universe of potential opportunities there in terms of quality, volume and capital allocation in your tax and even co-investment with your partners? I know it's a pretty broad question, but that would be helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. I will address that Tiago. Thanks for joining the call today, Carl Hansen, here. So first, just to be clear, we would not characterize this as co-development. What we have is an option to co-fund on a program-by-program basis and on a staged basis various programs. So that allows us to put capital to work for programs where we have conviction in the indication and where, we are confident in the qualities of the molecules that have come through.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And of course we have done the work in discovering those or well positioned to make that assessment. That option we see as another way to add value in deals. It is not the only way that we will do business really our main strategy is to be the Company that makes long-term investments that allow for rapid discovery at high quality and to do that at scale. And we are not dogmatic about the way that we will do deals to capture value on that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The one consistent theme is that we are looking not to take or two big bets on single assets, but to diversify across a large number of assets, which of course we have done. And to shift this quarter is to given that we have a strong book of work from 2021 that we are still working on. We are now looking for opportunities that we believe could meaningfully move the business. But we are not looking for those at the exclusion of our base business in doing discovery deals, which is still something that we are working on and we are excited about.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet, your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Puneet Souda</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. Hi, Carl and Andrew, thanks for taking the question. So, just following up on that, I mean, at a high level, has there been any shift towards exploring optionality to invest into your own development separately, or otherwise, despite the, obviously, the focus on helping your partners grow and scaling up the business?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Carl here. So I'm happy to take that one as well. Again, our strategy is to build a competitive advantage on all the steps that sit between target identification and go all the way through to, but not including clinical development. That's where we believe technology can make a difference, to increase speed and quality and to open up new target opportunities. So, it is not our intention to pivot and to work on internal programs, but we do have long range R&amp;D efforts underway to AbCellera of which the CD3 work is a prime example, where we have seen a need, and we have taken initiatives to solve that need.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in the process of proving that out, we will need to validate that across a variety of different, target antigens and tumor antigens. When we do that, our plans for that are absolutely to partner those as soon as possible. And that scenario, of doing R&amp;D that leads to assets that could be partnered is not at all different from what we've done in the past. In fact, that's exactly what we did with COVID-19. So, it is it is the nature of this R&amp;D that you need to work on real things. And when you work on real things, you have the possibility to anticipate needs from partners, for the benefit of both sides.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Puneet Souda</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the new program starts maybe this is for Andrew, appreciate that your focus on new programs starts worse with contract ads. But as I look at it, last two quarters, you had nine program starts and then only six this quarter. Maybe just help us understand is this a capacity or is it just first quarter seasonality or any other reason why we're seeing fewer programs starts despite your focus on new program starts largely? And is their capacity or any other thing that's getting the expansion in the numbers here?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Booth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great question, Puneet. As we've already said the program starts on a quarter to quarter basis will be slightly irregular. And the real metric to watch is going to the longer term trend of these programs starts. And that's why in the prepared remarks, I commented on the trailing 12 months growth over the previous period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It will be irregular and you have to also remember that in each of these programs, we are doing more and more work on each of the programs that we start, which is actually an increase in the capacity that we have within the organization and the capabilities. So, we will continue to see this irregularity in going forward and that should be expected. I think what really is to be watched is that longer term trend as well as the sense of how much more we're doing on a per program basis.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Puneet Souda</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then just last one, Carl this for you on. Yes, sorry, go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I was going to layer on top of that, that, if you look out over the next two, three years, as I mentioned, we are making heavy investments in forward integration. So work on translational science, CMC, GMP manufacturing, we are starting to take programs forward on the frontend of that right now. And so you can expect that in terms of capacity building, that dimension of doing work for program, I suspect is at least as big as is the volume metric that is reflected in program starts. So that's important to keep in mind.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Puneet Souda</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then Carl given the current cash position and the cash generation that's ongoing with the bebtelovimab and the COVID antibodies, appreciate that is unpredictable and that can completely change, but when you look at the overall market today, multiples have continued to contract and both the therapeutics and broadly across healthcare. Has that changed your view or the lens or how you're looking at the opportunities at this point in time?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I interpret that question as being one about inorganic editions of the technology class. Yes, we have a history of that. And we always survey the landscape to look for technologies that either would expand or improve our existing platform. That said, at this point, we believe we have assembled the best frontend in the industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the path now to complete this right up to IND is going to be primarily focused on organic growth in translational science, CMC and GMP. So we are certainly open to opportunities. But at this point, it's very much an internal facing efforts to complete this project that we started a decade ago, and given the capital and given that this is mostly about execution, and team building, we believe completing that now is inevitable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our next question comes from Stephen Willey with Stifel. Stephen, you line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Stephen Willey</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Just going back to the Empirico arrangement. Can you just remind us what are the inflection points, that allow you to make these investment decisions? I know, you're saying that it's staged, which is kind of curious if you can maybe speak to some of the triggers, which allow you to then make these decisions?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Stephen, I can take that one. It's without disclosing too much, there are go-no-go stages in the early discovery, and don't-go-no-go stages trigger an option on our part to continue to fund the work. The first of those would be in funding to an IND filing. And then there would be stages at various breakpoints in clinical development which would line up with, Phase 1, 2, 3 type activities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Stephen Willey</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. So the take was human and perhaps across the seven potential targets that are covered under the deal that you may have, I guess, a different ownership position in each of these assets, depending upon your view of the opportunity?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's exactly right. We would look at -- go ahead Andrew.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Booth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I was going to say that's exactly the right way to think about it, Stephen. So, and this is very similar to other deals, similar deals we've done, where, as you would imagine, the more you invest along the greater ownership position that you take, if it's a partner who chooses to advance that molecule where we have not invested, then it's sort of a pre-agreed terms on the percentage ownership position that we would have, depending on how long we have funded for.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Stephen Willey</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I guess, maybe just given some of the attrition that we've seen in the therapeutic space, specifically against amongst those kind of smaller cap development stage, biotechs. Just wondering if you've seen any kind of impact on the business development front, and I guess whether or not you think that the model that you guys provide to a potential company is more attractive in a liquidity constraint environment than perhaps it is when things are better.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks Steve. Carl here. So, obviously it's been trying times in the market, as, as mentioned on the comments, our business is in terrific shape. So we are strong and we are executing on our strategy, that's not the case broadly. That said, recently we have seen a strong uptick in activity and business development discussions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I believe a good part of that is a response to the data that was presented at AACR on CD3 work. It's probably too early to know exactly how market conditions are going to impact all partners, but I would agree with you that, our model provides a way for companies to continue advancing programs, to do that more quickly and more capital efficiently, while preserving their resources.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, we typically structure our deals with value sharing based on success in clinical development and ultimately in the approval of therapies and that lines up well with companies that are not -- that are cautious about building internal capabilities and taking on the complexity and cost of distributed outsourcing. So, we think that could well be a tailwind, but I think it's still a bit early to tell.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Stephen. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Capital Markets. Gaurav, your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and for the time. Just two for me. So when looking at new product opportunities, are you only entertaining deals at entitled southern to downstream participation, or are you still open to let's a new non-downstream payment deal?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Booth</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks Gaurav. Andrew here. No, when we really only look exclusively at business development opportunities that have downstream participation, so that has been the case for some time. I guess there are some with the Gates Foundation or Delta where we have managed to make applications for grant funding, which are really investments in the platform and capabilities. And sometimes those deals we would do on a case-by-case basis, but it's a very different dynamic in that grant funding environment than it is when you are doing discovery on actually a commercial, potentially commercial molecule and all of those deals have downstream participation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Got it. Thanks. And then, if you are looking more long-term, right. What level are you looking to continue diversifying the modality exposure? Do you expect a broader focus on the calling antibodies to continue to dominate the pipeline including from new products as well? Or do you eventually envision Abcellera having a more modality-balanced pipeline, as it seems like you guys are continuing to explore new modalities that they see fit?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Carl here. I can take that one. So, we are squarely focused on therapeutic antibodies defined quite broadly. So that would include monoclonal bispecifics other modalities that include antibodies as part of the composition of matter. Looking forward, we expect that main drivers of this sector are going to be discoveries in biology that are amenable to antibody therapies in a variety of different ways. It's also going to be new modalities that allow you to use antibodies to get novel mechanisms of action.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Within that class, we're very bullish on the future of five specifics and are making big investments on that capability. And third is going to be about being able to unlock target space where there are large numbers of well validated targets that represent a giant market opportunity, but where the industry has struggled mightily over the past couple of decades to find molecules that are suitable for development.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are -- we have a long-term research effort on that front, looking particularly at GPCRs and ion channels. Those are tough problems, but we're making good progress and we aim to be a major enabler for that part of the sector.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Gary, your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Gary Nachman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So for the six molecules in the clinic, what's the earliest that we might hear about some clinical data from the non-Lilly b-mab molecules, you added one in the first quarter through Trianni. Could you be on pace to put a few molecules in the clinic every year from your different partnerships? And when could those other four generate good revenue for you, whether it's in terms of hitting certain milestones, or ultimately getting to market but that's probably still away?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gary, good to hear from you. Yes, exactly right. This is why we focus on the portfolio, of course, we have a large portfolio, that is, we would expect consistently molecules from that portfolio would start to hit the clinic. Of course, we also expect some attrition in that portfolio. That's just the nature of drug development. With regards to those molecules that are the six that we show, of course, two of them are the COVID related molecules. So, we've seen the progress of those.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we don't have a lot of visibility on individual programs. And actually, we've designed the portfolio strategy to move away from looking at programs like things on a program by program basis. So, I think we would hope that more molecules would enter the clinic in the coming year, and, of course, the years to come. And we will start to see that as a more-steady stream. And then we will be watching the progress of those molecules as they advance through the clinic.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">They'll certainly be some milestone revenue and I would think that there will be some material milestone revenue in the coming years. But remember, these molecules right now, aside from the COVID molecules are in Phase 1. So they're still very early in the clinical development. And they'll mature over the coming like three to five years. And as they progress through, we've got millions and millions of dollar milestones every time a molecule would advance through clinical development. And we would expect to see that and recognize as it happens.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Gary Nachman</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then Carl, regarding the panel of CD3 antibodies. Can you have multiple partnerships for different types of cancers? How soon can you potentially partner those? Are there any real gating factors? And then, would you potentially keep some of these for yourself? I mean, sounds like from what you said earlier that you probably going to partner out all these antibodies. So I'm just curious if there's even a possibility that you might keep some of these when you're on development on.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So first, we do not have plans to, in the foreseeable future move into clinical development with these. So, it is really about building technologies that enable this class and therapeutics. The underlying hypothesis here is that it is not true that a single or a small number of CD3 antibodies are optimal for any given tumor antigen or class. To me that is, on its face, very likely to be true, it hasn't yet been proven, largely because people have been restricted in the diversity that they have.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we have taken the initiative to build in a very short time, what I believe is the biggest panel in the industry. And we now are going to do work internally, combining those with a variety of different tumor antigens, to prove that the potency and T cell activation is dependent upon the appropriate combination of CD3 and the tumor binder. And it's not something that you can solve with just one arm. So that work I feel we need to do to validate and get people to understand that paradigm of thinking about this class.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In terms of partnering, we're already getting a ton of interest. So we've had, I'd say almost twice the business development activity in the last month than is typical. And most of that has been driven by companies that are in the oncology space, that haven't been able to secure technologies to get a good position in what looks to be one of the most exciting classes of therapeutics. And they see this as an opportunity to get ahead. And we exist as an organization to help people more quickly and effectively develop better drugs. So that's what we're focused on right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our next question comes from Do Kim with Piper Sandler. Do, your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Do Kim</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I just have one. I know you can't say much about the Empirico collaboration program that the first one that you completed discovery. But I was hoping that you could talk about maybe how challenging it would be to get antibodies to this first GPCR target using conventional means and how you were able to get your process through?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks Do. So yes, we're very excited about that program. So it's difficult to say for any given target, how difficult it would be with one technology or another. What I can say is that in this case, if the GPCR target, which is widely viewed as one of the most difficult classes, probably next to ion channels. What is particularly impressive about this one is that we went from initiation of this to generation have a very large panel of antibodies and many highly potent functional antibodies that have moved into in vivo testing, at a speed that I believe is unprecedented for this class.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, we are very excited about the quality and diversity of this program of molecules that have been developed in this program, but also on the speed. And I see this has a proof point, yet another proof point for our main thesis that if you spend the time to really build the engine, if you work on the technology to increase performance and generate speed. You can turn ideas into therapeutic candidates much faster than has conventionally been done in the industry.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's something that we showed before on bamlanivimab, We showed it best-in-class molecule with bebtelovimab. We have generated what I think is the largest panelist CD3 in the space of six months. And the first program was Empirico shows us also succeeding on GPCR targets. So our goal is to keep performing and layering on that evidence, demonstrating that we have got a technology that is really moving the needle therapeutic antibodies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our next question comes from Antonia Borovina with Bloom Burton.

Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been answered so just a couple. So, I know that you are very limited with what you can discuss regarding the Trianni partner program advancing into the clinic. But just wondering if you could remind us of the typical deal structure for the Trianni partnerships and how they compare to the rest of your pipeline? And then if you could just give us an update on what you are forecasting for your cash runway? Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dr. Carl Hansen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, thanks. Thanks Antonia. Good to hear from you. On the Trianni licenses, these molecules are or these agreements for things that were negotiated by Trianni when it was under different ownership.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are typically seeing low single-digit royalty amounts on these, and milestones that are typical of our own programs. But the royalty rates are significantly lower, I would say than the typical program. And as we outlined in the 10-K, on our full year results for 2021, we showed what those average royalty rates are for our internal programs and the programs that we have under contract.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the cash runway, as we noticed here, we have a very healthy cash balance, and we indicated in the remarks that even with the big investment that we are making in facilities and team and expanding the team in all this work that we are doing, advancing the platform and technology, we have sufficient runway for at least the next three years, even given that very large investment that we are planning to make in the platform.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Antonio.
