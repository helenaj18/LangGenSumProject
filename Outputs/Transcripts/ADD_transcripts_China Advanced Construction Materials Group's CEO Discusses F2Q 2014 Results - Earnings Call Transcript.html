Mr. Xinyong Gao, the Financial Controller of the Company. Now I have prepared remarks from Mr. Han that has been translated into English and I will now read on Mr. Han’s behalf.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Xianfu Han</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">(Interpreted)</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. We experienced a year-over-year decrease in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, to the impact from the Chinese macro-economic situation, such decrease was principally due to the slowing down of the housing market and infrastructure development.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In order to curtail future losses we will continue our efforts to improve the collection of accounts receivables, and enhance our client base for the rest of the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the second quarter fiscal year 2014 financial highlights, our revenue decreased 45% year-over-year to $11.8 million. Gross margin at 12.7%, net loss available to common shareholders of $5.7 million a loss per share of $3.83 $29.4 million in working capital at December 31, 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Second quarter fiscal year 2014 results. For revenues, for the first three months ended December 31, 2013, we generated total revenue of approximately $11.8 million compared to approximately $21.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of approximately $9.7 million or 43%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Such decrease is due to a reduction in sales generated from the concrete division for the three months ended December 31, 2013. Our concrete sales revenue was approximately $11.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of approximately $7.7 million or 40% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The decrease in revenues attributable to concrete sales was principally due to the decrease of sales in the areas in which we operate. Operations at one of our concrete producing plants was suspended until late 2013 due to the China International Garden Expo and a temporary suspension order imposed by the Beijing government for industrial activity in the area.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition, China’s Central government continues to impose restrictions on the purchase of residential apartments in order to regulate housing prices in China and the China’s economic growth has been decelerating since 2012 which has caused an adverse impact on the construction industry in China.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the three months ended December 31, 2013, we continued to supply concrete products to three railway projects in China through our portable plants, specially our projects located in Anhui Province.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">These three projects contributed approximately $0.4 million to our total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of approximately $2.1 million or 82%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in revenues attributable to our Manufacturing Services segment was principally due to the suspension of operations of a number of our portable plants during the three months ended December 31, 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For cost of revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2013 we generated total cost of revenues of approximately $10.3 million, compared to approximately $18.4 million the three months ended December 31, 2012 a decrease of approximately $8.1 million or 44%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to the overall decrease in production from our fixed concrete plants in the Beijing area and the decreased production from manufacturing services compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The cost of revenue on concrete decreased by approximately $6.8 million or 41% for the three months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012. Such decrease was due to a decrease in our concrete production volumes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Cost of revenue with respect to our manufacturing services was primarily due to our manufacturing services, which decreased by approximately $1.3 million or 77% during the three months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period last year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For gross profit, total gross profit was approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to approximately $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our gross profit for sale of concrete was approximately $1.4 million or 13% of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2013 compared to approximately $2.3 million or 12% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of approximately $0.9 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The decrease in gross profit for concrete sales for the three months ended December 31, 2013 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2012 reflects lower production volume.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our gross profit with respect to our Manufacturing Services was approximately $0.08 million or 17% for the three months ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.8 million from $0.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2012, while the gross profit margin decreased from 34% for the three months ended December 31, 2012 to 17% for the three months ended December 31, 2013.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Such decrease was principally due to the decrease in revenue from Manufacturing Services for three months ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the decrease in a number of portable plants and a lower production rates at our plants.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Provision for doubtful accounts; we incurred provision for doubtful accounts of $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $4.6 million as compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In accordance with our allowance for doubtful accounts policy, at the end of each quarter, we conduct an aging analysis of each customer's arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. The provision is 15% for accounts receivables past due more than 180 days, but less than one year, 60% for accounts receivable past due out one to two years and 75% for accounts receivable past due beyond two years.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The allowance for doubtful accounts increased to approximately $40.5 million at December 31, 2013 as compared to approximately $36.5 million at June 30, 2013, as a result of tightening monetary policy by the Chinese government causing a shortage in cash and declining business of certain of our customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For selling, general and administrative expenses we incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013, an increase of approximately $0.2 million or 11% as compared to approximately $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012. The increase was principally due to a $0.1 million increase in meals and entertainment expenses, and a $0.1 million increase in office expenses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For Research and development expenses; research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2013 was $0.2 million, a decrease of approximately $0.1 million or 13% as compared to approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The Company's research and development expenditure was maintained at a certain percentage of revenue. The $0.1 million decrease was mainly due to lower research and development expenditures resulting from decreased revenue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For loss realized from disposal of property; plant and equipment, for the three months ended December 31, 2013, we incurred an approximately $4000 loss realized from the disposal of property, plant and equipment. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we incurred a $0.2 million loss realized from the disposal of property, plant and equipment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss available to common shareholders. We recognized a net loss of approximately $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to a net loss of approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $2.2 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Such increase in net loss was primarily due to the decrease in gross profits of our concrete sales and the Manufacturing Services. And the increase in provision of doubtful accounts offset by the decrease in loss from termination of lease.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our balance sheet overview; China ACM had a working capital of $29.4 million at December 31, 2013 including $2.4 million in cash and equivalents, $11.9 million in restricted cash, $24.9 million in short-term investments, $47.8 million in accounts and notes receivable, $29.5 million in prepayments and advances, $5.7 million in other receivables and $100.2 million in current liabilities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Shareholders' equity was $45.9 million, compared with $56.7 million at June 30, 2013. The total number of shares outstanding as of February 6, 2013 was approximately 1.5 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the third quarter fiscal year 2014 and updated fiscal year 2014 guidance; for the third quarter ending March 31, 2014, management expects net sales of $7.5 million to $8.5 million, net loss of $2 million to $3 million and loss per share of $1.35 to $2.02 based on 1,486,871 weighted average shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, due to the uncertainties in some projects and the collection of accounts receivables, management expects net sales of $49 million to $51 million, net loss of $9 million to $15 million and loss per share of $6.05 to $10.09 based on 1,486,871 weighted average shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you it appears we have no questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any concluding comments. We have a question coming from the line of John Tini a Private Investor. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hello everybody. Thank you for hosting the call. I would like to ask about the guidance that you provided for this year. It’s a little bit difficult to understand the strength of the current business; because you have the net income guidance includes the provision for old doubtful accounts.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So could you breakout the expected income from current year operations without the allowance for doubtful accounts to help us better understand for the current business?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language – Chinese]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jemming Shang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Interpreted]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, to answer your question, actually in this Q, you can find that we have an allowance for doubtful accounts reaching almost $45 million. So if we do not consider the impact and the influence from this allowance for doubtful accounts, it is possible that for the fiscal year of 2014, we may have a net income of between $1 million to $2 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, thank you. That’s very helpful. Then…</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ken Ren</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I would like to further comment on these questions, because I want to caution the conference participants including John, you, yourself that the guidance information the management disclosed is a comprehensive approach to consider both the future revenues we are going to earn in the next two quarters along with the assessment of the collection effecting this and the creditworthiness of our outstanding accounts receivable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As Jemming pointed out that the current accounts receivables totaled at $88 million and up to the time as of December 31, 2013, we have already booked a cumulative current allowance for these doubtful accounts at $40 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, such that the total net accounts receivables outstanding at $47 million and we understand that this income guidance range is somewhat widened compared to the last time we updated such information because currently this can be re-provided at a range of $9 million to $15 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I believe this range although apparently appear to be difficult, it actually reflects the company’s conservativeness and the management assessment to include difficulties in its future collections of these accounts receivables. I just – impelled to emphasize the importance of accounts receivables impact our net income guidance forecast.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, thank you very much. That’s all very helpful. Then I would also like to ask about the employee stock purchase plan. This has been adopted that you plan to use this plan?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jemming Shang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay so what’s your question? You want to ask about the SPP right?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Right, so, I see you filed the legal documents to set up the plan. So are the employees going to be using this plan?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ken Ren</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I want to point out that this year SPP plan is an employee stock purchase plan instead of an employee stock compensation granting plan. It’s two different plans. So, the latter which is called employee stock granting plan or stock incentive plan is part of the compensation for the company to compensate this management and employees.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And these new plans, employee stock purchase plan in short, the acronym of the full name is to provide an opportunity for the company’s employees and management to invest into the company they work for. Which is, the company employee need to contribute their personal wealth or wages back to the company in exchange for the company’s stock.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Right, that’s right. I think it’s interesting and it would be a good signal to the independent shareholders if that plan is used, so that’s what I wanted to ask about it and understand whether the employees are going to be using that plan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ken Ren</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, we can’t comment on whether the employees are going to utilize such a plan or not as that we like to leave this decision to the employees themselves to decide and however from the company standpoint particularly from the Board stand, we like to provide such opportunities for our employees and management to be able to invest more into the company if they willing to.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, thank you very much for that explanation. Then, I would like to ask about the company’s financial condition. On a cash basis, the company has done pretty well in the past six months. Now the company has a free cash balance of about $2 million and short-term investments of $29 million. So, that’s quite a strong position and could you explain how the company will be using these funds?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language – Chinese]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jemming Shang</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Interpreted]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Since now the market condition in China is not so good, so, we are trying our efforts to looking for potential business opportunities. So, when there is a good opportunity coming out, we probably will use our cash to enhance our investment in the business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">What do mean when you say opportunities?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Ken Ren</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">You are largely correct to that, the company maintains a cash balance at approximately $2 million to $3 million and I want to point out at the beginning of the period which is the beginning of this fiscal year in last July, we had a cash balance of nearly $4 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And as of the end of the reporting period which is December and we have a cash balance of $2.4 million and out of this difference, you are correct and I would like to refer to our cash flow statements that we generated net positive cash provided from our operating activities about a little bit south of $10 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And please be cautious that out of this $10 million net cash provided by operating activities, 80% was contributed from the provision of doubtful accounts which still reflects the collection matter in this management of accounts receivables and the Chairman’s comments just that is emphasizing why we invest heavily in the short-term investments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As we pointed out in our – in the second segment in our cash flow statement, we invested, we paid nearly $20 million in acquisition of short-term investments. So we utilize these short-term investment vehicles such as the money market fund to preserve this very valuable cash balances.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And Mr. Han, the Chairman just commented that we are waiting for the best opportunities to launch these investments, the proceeds from the sale of investments if the opportunity becomes available to expand our business into the traditional concrete market business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in the meantime as the macro economy in China is going towards an intersection whether it is going to slowdown or the real estate market, property market will continue to remain hard to ramp up.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we believe that maintaining a strong cash balance with – while reserving enough in the short-term investments to enjoy or to use some returns from these short-term investments will preserve the safety and credit of this investment is our best position at this moment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in the meantime, you can thought that, the last segment in the cash flow statements we renewed our revolving credit line by paying some short-term loans and a bank guarantees, bank guarantees, but renew them with equivalent amounted to obtain a proceeds of $38 million in this short-term loan renewals.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So these cash management patterns and the financing activities actually has been somewhat consistent in the past two to three years and if you take a look at our historical financial statements along with our notes, you will not be surprised to find that this is actually the company’s cash management pattern.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Tini – Private Investor</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, thank you very much.
