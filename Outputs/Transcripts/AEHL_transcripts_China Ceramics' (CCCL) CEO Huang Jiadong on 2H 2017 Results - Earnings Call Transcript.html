First of all, I will turn around to Mr. Huang Jiadong the Chairman and CEO of China Ceramics and<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> Ms. Weijia Dai will be translating for Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang, you may proceed.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Huang Jiadong</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, David. On behalf of the company, I would like to welcome everyone to our second half fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the second half of 2017, we experienced slightly improved market conditions as compared to the same period of 2016, as we aggressively marketed our products utilizing a targeted strategic approach. We were able to improve our pricing power due to the popularity of our flagship porcelain ceramic tiles abetted by our strong market presence.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our revenue rose 7.1% for the second half of 2017 from the year-ago period primarily due to an 8.5% rise in our average selling price. In addition, our cash flow was reasonably strong after adjusting for asset write-offs during the year</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For fiscal year 2017 ended December 31, 2017, we utilized production facilities capable of producing 31 million square meters of ceramic tiles. Consistent with our practices in past quarters, we maintained or reduced utilization of existing plant capacity based on the current market condition to keep our operating costs low. We intend to bring additional capacity online as the business environment improves.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the remainder 2018, we are cautiously optimistic about an improved business environment due to new land sales and continued development activity as well as the government initiative to build rental homes as a means of balancing China's urban residential dynamics.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the long-term, we believe that real estate will continue to be vital to China's economy and essential for domestic growth. We plan to target those cities in China that offer potential for new property development and will continue to forge strong relationships with larger property developers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Foreign Language]</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would like to turn over the call to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Edmund Hen, who will discuss the Company’s second half 2017 earnings results in more detail. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Edmund Hen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Mr. Huang. I will now move on to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the six months ending December 31, 2017.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB485.3 million or $72.7 million, an increase of 7.1% from RMB453.1 million or $67.1 million for the same period of 2016. The year-to-year increase in revenue was primarily due to; the 8.5% increase in our average selling price of the Company’s ceramic tiles product to RMB27.2 or $4 in the second half of 2017 that is compared to RMB25.1 or $3.8 for the same period of 2016, which was partially offset by the 1.2% decrease in the sales volume to 17.9 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the second half of 2017 from 18.1 million square meters of ceramic tiles in the second half of 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross, profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB57.8 million, or $8.7 million, as compared to a gross loss of RMB80.3 million or $11.9 million for the same period of 2016. The gross profit margin was 11.9% for the six month ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a 17.7% gross loss margin for the same period of 2016, which was attributable to a latter period's 28% decrease in the ASP of the Company’s ceramic tiles resulting from price cuts to spur the sales of slow-moving inventory, and a RMB59.4 million or $8.9 million write-off of inventory in that period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Other income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB7.3 million or $1.1 million, as compared to RMB7 million or $1 million for the same period of 2016. Other income is mainly comprised of rental income that the Company received by leasing out one of the production lines from its Hengdali facility pursuant to an eight-year lease contract.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Selling expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB6.1 million, $0.9 million, as compared to RMB5.8 million, $0.8 million for the same period of 2016. The year-over-year decrease in our selling expense was mainly due to a decrease in adverting and travel, and travel expenses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB79.8 million or $12.1 million, as compared to RMB35 million or $5.2 million for the same period of 2016. The year-over-year increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to the write-off of bad debt due to what we feel as uncollectible debt associated with our vendors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss from asset devaluation resulting from an impairments of non-current assets for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB36.7 million or $5.5 million as compared to RMB230.4 million or $34.3 million for the same period of 2016. The loss from asset devaluation resulted from an impairment of non-current assets due to decelerating growth in China and an expected contraction in the demand for the Company's products.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB82.2 million or $12.4 million, as compared to a net loss of RMB351.3 million, or $52.4 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to increased gross profit and a lower loss from asset devaluation for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss per basic share and fully diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2017 on both a basic and fully diluted basis for RMB24.29 or $3.66 as compared to basic and fully diluted earnings per share of RMB127.47 or $18.99 for the same period of 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and bank balances of RMB2.3 million or $0.4 million as compared to RMB0.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Our short-term bank borrowings were nil as of both periods. As of December 31, 2017, our inventory turn was 95 days as compared to 108 days as of December 31, 2016. We had a reversal of inventory impairment of RMB2.73 million in 2017 as a result of an improved inventory turnover rate due to increased sales. Subsequent to the RMB75.1 million of inventory that was impaired for the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe that the value of our current inventories is realizable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our trade receivables turnover, as of December 31, 2017 was 206 days, compared with 209 days as of fiscal year ended 2016. The increase in trade receivables turnover days was primarily due to a continued difficult economic environment which has prompted us to offer extended credit terms to certain customers resulting in a higher trade receivables turnover figure than normal.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Trade payables turnover, net of value added tax was 32 days as of December 31, 2017 compared with 51 days as of December 31, 2016. The average turnover days was within the normal credit period of one to four months granted by our suppliers. In terms of our plants utilization and capacity, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we utilized plant capacity capable of producing 31 million square meters of ceramic tiles annually out of a total effective annual production capacity of 66 million square meters of ceramic tiles.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our Hengda facility now has an annual production capacity of 37 million square meters of ceramic tiles, as a result of two old furnaces having been put out of use in the facility. The Company utilized production capacity capable of producing 9.6 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 18.2 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the entire fiscal year 2017.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our Hengdali facility has an annual production capacity of 29 million square meters not including the leasing out of production capacity to a third party. And we utilized production capacity capable of producing 7.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 12.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the entire fiscal year 2017.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our annual production capacity has been effectively reduced from 72 million square meters of ceramic tiles to 66 million square meters of ceramic tiles due to an eight-year contract to lease out one of the production lines from our Hengdali facility that we entered into March 2016. We will bring our unused production capacity online as customer demand dictates and when there are signs of improvement in China's real estate and construction sector.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We incurred RMB5.6 million or $0.9 million in capital expenditure attributable to the purchase of equipment were RMB4.9 million and desulfurization tower for RMB0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although business conditions are subject to change, looking ahead to the remainder of 2018 we anticipate a low level of capital expenditures given the currently challenging market conditions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving on to our business outlook. In fiscal 2017, we increased the pricing of our ceramic tile products by 10% each in April and July, respectively. This followed a 20% decrease in prices of our slow-moving products beginning on October 1, 2016, that was instituted in an effort to convert some of our inventory into cash. Our renewed pricing strength in fiscal 2017 was generally accepted by the marketplace as our fiscal 2017 sales volume increased 10.6% from fiscal 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018, we expect conditions to slowly improve with an expansion in residential land supply, which will ultimately result in real estate development, especially in certain Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. In addition, the Chinese Government began a program to increase the development of rental homes, affordable housing and housing co-owned by individuals and the state to help stem real estate speculation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">There have also been efforts to develop rural land into rental housing which could help to address housing shortage and stabilize price increase in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. These initiatives could lead to an additional real estate development and help to offset inventory declines in certain regions. In addition, local governments have begun to go forward with construction project, which has resulted in property investment growth. In the long-term, we believe that the real estate sector continues to be vital to sustaining China's strong economic growth since it is an important component of China's GDP.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We typically receive orders from customers two months in advance of production on a rolling basis. We enter into dealership agreements with customers, and a sales or purchase contract each time a customer places an order. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately RMB70.7 million or $10.8 million, which represents approximately the next two months of revenue. This as compares to a backlog of approximately RMB61.4 million or $8.9 million as of December 31, 2016, a year-over-year increase of 15.1%.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Under normal circumstances, our backlog is an indicator of revenues that might be expected in the next quarter, though it is subject to a change due to unforeseen business conditions and events including credit payment terms.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We view the growth of real estate sector and our building materials sector as sustainable since China's urbanization, where the population continues to shift from rural to urban areas, serves as its foundation. In addition, urbanization is expected to lead to a more consumption-driven economy, a key objective of government policy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have refocused our efforts to where we see active real estate development and where property developers use our products as part of their finished home products. We believe we have a competitive advantage in our sector due to our comprehensive product platform, customization capabilities, marketing expertise and strong reputation. Our goal for the year ahead is to continue to strategically penetrate regions with sound fundamentals and generates sustainable sales volume consistent with current real estate development trends.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In an event that occur after our December 31, 2017 fiscal year-end. On April 24, 2018, we run effectively with a capital raise of $1.2 million in capital raise, through the sales of 770,299 of common stock at a purchase price of $1.56 per share, to a certain individual investors. Proceeds from the Offering shall be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Offering was 10% to a previously filed and effectively Registration Statement in prospectus supplement.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this point, we would like to open up the call to any questions pertaining to our second half and fiscal year 2017 financial results.
