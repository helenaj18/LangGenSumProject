And we're very excited to have Michael Linford here the CFO of Affirm, and we're going to jump into a bunch of fireside chat questions, we are going to give the audience a chance to ask some as well.</p> <p>So Michael, thanks for joining us. Plenty going on, lots of talk about I'm actually not going to start with a credit or funding question because we'll get to those, don't get me wrong. But let's actually start with competitive landscape. I would love to get your perspective on providing our pay later, how is the landscape evolve? How would you kind of segment it? We obviously saw the announcement that was long awaited from Apple about Apple Pay Later, where do you think that might fit in? And we can take it from there.</p> <p><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p>So I think it's refreshing to return to the point of the conversation about I think it's the most important thing for us, which is the fundamental shift in consumer behavior that we're tapping into. And we talked a lot about that over the past year, I think over the past six months with the uncertainty in the macro environment. We've had some talking about it. And I think a lot folks have forgotten what's actually going on underneath the surface, which is consumers are still voting with their wallets, away from traditional payment methods, credit cards and debit cards and finding new ways to extend purchasing power, and to do it safely without the fear of revolving debt.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible iS_EF">And that trend is going on -- has been going on for a few years. It's the core thing that we tap into. And we think it will continue. I mean, Apple's announcement this week is another marker on that. It is a proof point. And this is not a nitchy thing on<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> the side, it has gone mainstream. And it's our view that this will continue to take share in terms of consumer spending and will continue to be a material part of how consumers are willing to help merchants can effectively convert transactions. I think that the landscape is evolving.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And it's not surprising, anytime you have the kind of hyper growth of this industry has had where, we estimated a little over 3% of GMV, ecom GMV last year, estimates range, but 8% to 9% over the next three years, I think it'll be slightly higher than that. Anytime you have that level of secular growth, you do have a lot of people who want to participate in the game. And you've seen that, ourselves and a few of the kind of pure play companies had been in market selling services to merchants and consumers over the past several years. You also seen companies like PayPal enter the market last year, they obviously entered and generated a lot of volume very quickly. You've seen the credit card companies trying to do a post purchase post-financed product that they want to think is the same idea of building an installment loan into the core credit product. And that's going to continue and think that that Apple's announcements really another piece on that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I would say that there's more we don't know about what we do know Apple is, obviously quite secretive. I wouldn't worry about trying to ask the question is Apple lending company or a tech company? I don't think you'd have to answer that one. Because I do think that what they're trying to do is engage their consumer with a product, which I think is a really good thing. They raise their hand and joined us in the no late fee version of the product, which I think is really important, because we think you can create an honest financial product when you do that. It's important that you can underwrite well, when you do that, you can't rely on carrots and sticks in order to get people to pay you back, you actually have to do the underwriting. And they join the ranks of ourselves and our key partners like Amazon, and Shopify and insisting that these products are all without late fees.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think it's a good thing for the consumer, I think it's a good thing for the industry to have such a strong technology leader like Apple offer these products to their consumers. And I think it'll be a really cool feature for Apple consumers. I don't think it impacts us directly because I think our predominant way we go-to-market is not through wallets. It's actually through merchants. And those merchant integrations are things that we spent a lot of time building over the years. And there's a relationship very deep and very sticky. And our ability to command strong MDRs and multiple revenue streams is very different than what the Apple Pay Later product looks like.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Today, we think, again, there's more we don't know about it than what we know. So we're not super stressed about it. We think it's on the balance a good thing for us, and we're particularly proud that they're helping set the standard on no late fees. Meanwhile, I think what you're seeing in the pure play BNPL space is a bit of a bit of a retreat. I think you're seeing folks be a lot more risk off, which is a total opportunity for us.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think we've always been a leader in how we think about risk, underwriting, capital markets credit, those are things that we're actually invested a lot of energy in, and we're quite good at. And as a result in these environments, we're able to take share from our competitors, who I think are a little bit more risk off given their uncertainty in the macro environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">A lot of chatter in the market about the health of the lower income consumer, and just wanting to get a sense from you. Now, obviously, with stimulus being in the rearview mirror, can you give us some sense of the income level ranges of Affirm user base and where the kind of GMV concentration is, by income level.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We don't give detailed stats to everybody to be able to break it down, I think the thing directionally we tell you is, it's very representative for the U.S. consumer. When you cover 60% of U.S. ecommerce with the likes of Amazon and Walmart, you end up with a pretty good representative sample of the U.S. consumer. There is a lot of chatter on the low-end consumer, the low income consumer. And I think there's just a couple of things that are important there. The first is, we're really good at stacking risk in our business. And the way we actually measure whether or not macro environment has caused an impact in our ability to effectively price and underwrite loans, is whether or not we see drift in our models. And so as you can imagine, in this environment, where quite diligently studying every possible data point, to see if we had any drift, and today, we've seen that. And that's not to suggest that you won't see it. But we have a lot of confidence that even as things do deteriorate for any subset of consumers, our short duration asset combined with our strong orientation in data and data science, and a really good model, it's works really quite well, will allow us to generate high quality assets in any environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we included a slide for all investors in the room, we included a slide in our last investor presentation, that kind of gives you a sense of the shape of the curve. And it's by our credit score, and not by income, because things do connect. And if you look at it, the steepness is quite sharp. So for the first several deciles of consumers, the losses are high, but relatively flat, and then it's the last couple of deciles, where you really do all of the money is made right. And in particular, the steepness is very, very, very sharp on that marginal consumer. So the last one we make is the least profitable loan that we make. And that ability, that insight that's deep curve on the underwriting side allows us to be very selective about risk and dial that up and down. And that's not just a statement of competence, which it is, but we did it. I mean, that's what you saw in our results last quarter that the really strong results that we posted were a function of us, really grabbing the steering wheel and being very thoughtful about the kind of risk that we're taking. And we saw the same thing during COVID, admittedly, it was a was a flash crisis that was resolved with a lot of stimulus.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think a lot of folks don't understand for that the lower income consumer that stimulus went away, like the middle, it did not have the same lingering effect that a lot of folks think it did. I think the bigger thing on people's minds now is the inflationary environment, putting pressure on that consumer more so than the lack of stimulus. And there, we just we haven't seen it, we actually think that the growth in nominal wages for our consumer puts us in a really strong position to help the consumers pay for the goods that are obviously more expensive in an inflationary environment. But with the nominal growth in wages more than makes up for the risks that might exist there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So maybe let's build on that a little bit more, your CEO Max put out a blog post on Friday talking about how the loan book might perform in a downturn. So maybe just to drill into that a bit further. The message that management has consistently sent is that a firm can essentially control the level of delinquencies, right? And that I think gives you the confidence that the business will be resilient in a downturn. So maybe you can just talk through that a little bit more how you guys think about solving for a certain level of delinquencies, and if there's any numbers you can share there. But what levers do you pull? What are the signals that you monitor to make those determinations of what the optimal delinquency level might be at any point in time? </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. So the first thing is to remember the duration of our asset and the Split Pay side of our business, the asset is super short. It's a three-week weighted average life, which just means that you're getting signals real-time and the book is a function of the front book at all times, if that makes sense. You're not carrying around the back book you're trying to manage. It's the decision you make today that will impact where you are in a month. And so then it's about being hyper vigilant about where you pick your approvals. And because what we do is different than some of our competitors. We actually underwrite every transaction and we do sort of risk for every transaction and so on the Split, they said, we can pick the level of loss. And then three weeks we get a very good signal about whether or not that level of loss is where we expected it to be. And if it is, we're continue to operate there. And if it starts to deviate or drift, like I said, we would be able to tighten.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And again, it's a function of the very large dataset that we have. Last quarter, I think the number was 20 million transactions that we were processing on the platform, kind of which we approved. That's a lot of [indiscernible]. And it's a bit like a baseball batting average in that it's not that you need to hit a homerun every time because they aren't long 30 year mortgages. This is about the law of very large numbers, which means it blends itself quite well to a data science driven approach to thinking about the problem. We don't have human underwriters evaluating credit files. We have models that help us estimate and sort the risk.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the longer duration part of our business, we do have to think about that. But again, a five-month weighted average life so pales in comparison to most of the other folks who are used to lending in any cycle. And so the approach is very similar, we're just a lot more thoughtful about where we draw those lines. So we have an internal credit score called ITEX, which is a transaction level credit score, we don't score users, we score transactions, a transaction can be higher risk to bid, depending upon the channel the consumer is shopping in, it can be higher risk based upon the time of day, my favorite very small and unimportant example is that risk at two o'clock in the morning goes up. And you can see it clear as day. And it's just goes like this. And then 3:30 it goes back down because they're in bed again.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And it's true, I'm not making this up. And so it's a small signal. But you can eke out a marginal benefit in underwriting by taking the whole transaction into account. The same consumers at higher risk at different time of day, the same consumers is at a higher risk depending upon what they buy. And we take all that information in and we make a risk calculus on that particular transaction. And we do that a lot. And then, we learn from what worked and didn't work we learned from new signals, and we're constantly rolling out new models. And we were up public about that, we might start celebrating that a little bit more for folks, we roll out new credit models, because they're really interesting and the quality of signal that we get as user, because we have all that data. And because we have the discipline to say we're going to pick a risk point and decide where it is. And then we monitor the heck out of it and a short duration asset allows us to correct if things ever deviate. We have the strong sense that we're in control.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I won't show these charts. But if I showed them to you like, I promise you, you guys would quickly roll your eyes back because there's like these hundreds of lines and cover ties, charts. And we can do that because we're not looking at making a qualitative assessment anywhere. It is a data driven approach. And the data speaks to us. And if we see a deterioration, we react to it, and it's about the process to build the model, and then the monitoring behind it. And both two things we've invested in from day one, even when it wasn't cool, right? It wasn't cool to do that a year ago.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We collect the last four digits of your social security number. And for the longest time, there are still a product in order to connect all the way back to your credit bureau file. And that is the thing that put us at a big disadvantage because our competitors didn't. We found a workaround to be able to sort of pull credit data without that last four of your social security number and still complete the underwriting that we want to get to [prior] [ph] parity. But we were solving the problem all along about how do we get the credit data in that transaction, how we underwrite that transaction. With a lot of folks in the industry, we're just thinking late fees, and then excluding you from the system was enough. And I think what you're seeing now is it's not enough. And when you do so at risk, you get differentiated outcomes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it sounds like you believe that your whole credit model is a real favorable differentiator versus the peer group out there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's a differentiator. And we believe that the two things model was good. We can stack it against FICO, we can stack it against any other credit model, and we sort risk better. But what are unique in that. There are other credit models out there that sort better than the traditional models, because traditional models aren't good. That being said, we have that advantage. And the structural advantage of being a transaction level underwriter, where you're looking at 10s of millions of transactions. And because you're looking at lots of little transactions, and you're sitting and making yes or no decisions on every single time the consumer would like to buy something, you have a very different set of credit outcomes, then, if you took that same credit model and applied it to say a credit card company who has to extend to the consumer several years worth of capacity to buy things, we're not doing that that's not the decision we make when we extend credit.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So do you feel materially different about the quality of your loan portfolio today versus let's say the start of the calendar year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. I think it's materially better. I think that we have been very thoughtful about where we are at. We talked about the small optimizations we made in our last earnings call. And I think we're pretty vigilant right now. I think we are concerned, like everybody else is. We read the news. We watch TV, too. We have the same generalized external concerns. We will see it in our data, but it does cause us to be thoughtful. And so yes, I feel better about it today than I did six months ago.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it's basically demonstrating that ability to tweak as needed as macro conditions change and grow really fast. You are not sacrificing top line in the process.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, exactly. I think that's the other thing. A lot of folks say, I got this feedback from an analyst not as smart as you, Jason, who said that our answer was unsatisfactory on credit. They're wanting us to say something bad. And I apologize, which is not a bad thing here. We don't have to stop growing in order to be prudent on risk. The market we're in is so growth full. We're growing from small, single digit penetrations of ecom, or on a path to getting towards over double-digit penetrations. You don't have to be so reckless on credit to grow really fast. And that's the way we operate it a year ago, and two years ago, when the market was rewarding it. It is how we're going to operate now. It's really no different.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Right. I mean, the other argument that we've kind of been making is that, everyone's fixated on credit. And those metrics are super important. But at the end of the day, you guys are managing the business, also to a certain level of unit economics. And you've been consistent, really, since the IPO saying 3% to 4% in terms of gross profit as a percentage of GMV. You've been comfortably above that, right? And I actually remember last year on an earnings call, I asked you, I said, you're at like five, and it's 3 to [4.20] [ph]. And you said, no, it's not too low, right? And that's when everything felt great. And here, we are getting closer to the 3% to 4% range. And that's how the model is supposed to work.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, I thought it was interesting on the earnings call last month, you guys basically said that you're very comfortable that you can sustain the 3% to 4% range in fiscal 23. You're not giving official guidance yet. But I would just like to hear a little bit more what kind of underpins that confidence? Because there's so many pieces that go into the gross profit equation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Linford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. I think the profit equals revenue minus cost to that's a big insight there. So on the revenue side, we feel really good about our sources of revenue, we earn on split pay very high MDRs, on interest bearing, the interest-bearing content and loan is substantially above our costs. And so we have the revenue content there. And then, you think about the cost of what's going on? Well, you have the credit environment, and we just got done talking about it, we feel really confident about our ability to pick that. And then you have cost of funds. And a lot of folks are really focused on the higher costs of running the business. We talked about this on two earnings calls ago, we wanted to give people a framework, we actually did the math for you, we laid it out.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I think, again, folks don't quite grasp that our liabilities are, the way we fund the business are kind of committed, and they're out further than the asset. So we're urging assets into existing funding models that we have a high degree of confidence and uncertainty in the cost. We don't have a lot of uncertainty about how we will fund the business next quarter, and the next six months or the next year, far enough out, there's a little bit of ambiguity depending upon the growth. But in the near-term, we're pretty confident and most of that funding is on a fixed cost basis. And so we know the class it will take to fund our business next year, we have a high degree of confidence there, we have a high degree of confidence on picking the level of credit losses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so at that point in time, the units are really well protected. The other costs in there are things like servicing and hand processing that are just very easy for us to predict and deliver leverage on. And so where we have confidence. The bigger thing that's going on. And the reason why if you asked me again, even if we post a number about 4%, I'll still give you the same answer of 3% or 4%. I'll be very consistent on that. And the reason why it's not bigger is just the mix in our products. We're mixing into the split pay product. And the split pay product is further 5% revenue product that can't possibly be making 5% of margin because there's cost and so that was a 1% to 2% business and a 5% to 6% business, it kind of gets you to where you're at.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the reason why that number is going to keep coming down is because we are mixing differently and it's a constant refrain from us. It was a big topic of the revenue take rates over the past year when we were mixing out at Peloton and it's a big topic going forward around mixing into split pay was over 20% of our business last quarter. And it's a really important engagement tool for us. But obviously it's a lower margin on the percentage GMV basis because it's a lower revenue take product as well. And so we feel very good about business profitability. We love it. We are going to keep investing in it. When you combine those two things, you are going to continue to have that number drift downwards into that 3% to 4% range.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Q - Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Yes. We're halfway through, any questions from the audience. Anybody want to ask anything? Let's start here. We'll come over here.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, so I think you've talked about three or four different tranches of business, right? You've got the split pay business, and then you've got short-term, it's smaller transactions, right? And then they go up. If we just think about consumer spending, and potentially some of the bigger ticket transactions coming down as discretionary income levels get tighter? How do you think about that, in that margin mix?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Obviously, we'll impact it if we mixed fundamentally differently, you saw that. You saw the Peloton business, which was a very good example of a larger considered purchase, that obviously impacted the shape of the P&amp;L. But I would disagree a little bit with the premise, I don't think that the need to finance discretionary purchases goes down in these times. Our product means more to consumers. And, we have a wide conviction around what that product will mean to consumer, what the financing will do for a consumer who still needs a couch and still needs a TV even though the stock market is down.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it'd be a share issue for you, right? Because that potentially, in the United States, you'll see the number of discretionary transactions at those higher levels coming down, but you'll then --- you will aim for a bigger share.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">MichaelLinford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, there's going to be less cash purchases. And I think, this is, again, this is not just shooting from the head, what we saw early in COVID. And the history was obviously written in a way where it ended up not mattering. But going back to 2020 in March, everybody was concerned. And the level of uncertainty was very widespread. And what you saw with respect to applications was, you saw consumers who were middle and up the credit stack, applying for credit in times that they wouldn't. And we think that same thing is going to play out in a normal recession, where folks who are going to be mindful about risk of unemployment, they're going to be mindful about their total cash consumption being more open to paying for things over time, which helps us that's a good thing for us.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. So you see enough visibility and being able to manage that mix. My last question is, and maybe I misunderstood you, but I'm not clear on the funding costs being fixed. Okay, so can you just clarify that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We fund our business in three ways. We have warehouse financing, which is floating rate -- that's floating. We utilize, I think, in the mid 30s of our warehouse capacity, not the predominant way we hold assets to maturity. We use those mostly to assets until we can do one of the other two funding methods for them. The other two funding methods are forward flow. These are bilateral arrangements with committed capital levels, where we sell loans to counterparties on a whole loan basis.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we'll sell the loan to an insurance company, we onboarded an insurance company in May. And we'll sell loans that they buy the whole loan, they commit to an extended duration, let's call it 18, 24 months is what we usually talk about. And we negotiate a price and actually negotiate a pricing table because each loan has a grade and everything else, and we sell it to that loan buyer on a fixed price. And so rates going up and down doesn't change that price until we hit a renewal for that 24-month period. There are some of our core four agreements that have some floating pricing in it. There are some of our four flow agreements that have episodic repricing, so I don't want to be -- I'm not painting it with universality here. But a lot of our capacity doesn't have that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then we also fund the business with the securitization program and very active in the ABS world. And those are all fixed rate borrowings. And again, those deals are committed and long in duration. And so we might do a 24-month securitization, like we did last year when rates were really good. And we benefit from that today. Because these are revolving securitizations.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So they're fixed, but they'll gradually roll off.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">MichaelLinford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. Think of it as like, I think we've done nine or 10, securitization deals. We have a handful of workflow partners and a handful where -- there's like, dozens of different funding arrangements and SPDs that we had. And so each one of these things has a staggered expiration, and as those roll off, we have to deal with it, but it's, it's like for 2% of our costs or two federal funding. We might have a 2% increase in costs, and we have to manage that and we will.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we have a lot more visibility in the near term. I think the rising rate environment isn't troubling about for us until it gets to a much higher level of race. And if it does, even then it's a problem for us, 18 to 24 months out not today.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that level, when does the model break?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's a really good question. We worded differently than when does it break? We talked about it is when do we start having to change things in order to make it work? I've thrown out numbers like, hey, look, if rates are at 10%, on a sustained basis, we have to change a lot in our business. But if rates are at 4%, we feel pretty good.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Short-term, at the short end of the curve. Yeah. Okay.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When you say then consider [indiscernible]. Does that include going back to the merchant?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. It includes revenue and cost initiatives on the revenue side, it's repricing with merchants and with consumers. On the cost side, it's everything we can do to drive leverage in the business leverage on the cost items, including payment processing and the like. And there's levers that we have out there that we haven't pulled that we would pull in those environments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Question in front. Yes.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. So just going back to Apple Pay Later. I know a lot is still unfolding. But what would you say the customer overlap is between Apple Pay and maybe either other by Buy Now Pay Later or just Affirm in particular?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We don't know because it's not even live yet. So it's really difficult thing to say, we can't tell you how often consumers go to use our app and put our virtual card inside of an Apple wallet today and that's a data point. And it's a trivial amount of our volume goes to that mode today.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think that if you start where I started on who our consumer is, and it's a widespread consumer, it's kind of representative of America. I think that's where the overlap would eventually get to. But I think Apple does index higher income indexes to folks who have Chase Sapphire cards. And that's definitely not our target consumer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think if you compare it, though, to some of the other BNPLs out there -- BNPLs players out there, I suspect it's pretty far away from them. I suspect that if you look at, like the overlap between the block consumer, whether it's cash app or after pay, and you compare that after pay, I'm guessing that's much further away.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. Do you think you could talk a little bit to your strategy around offline, specifically kind of debit plus and some of your distribution partnerships?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think offline, for our category remains the most exciting piece of huge upside. We also talk a lot about BNPL penetration in ecommerce. And we've always measure it that way. In the course, that's ignoring 70% to 80% of commerce. And I think the opportunity there is enormous. And I would say the industry has not really solved it, like digital payments offline has not really been solved, it's still a thing that lags quite a bit. So it remains a big opportunity. One way that you can solve that is build an app and do NFC and everything else. And we've done that. We do QR codes at Walmart. These things all suffer from any number of limitations that cause it to not get the same traction, you can get online and excited for the debit card plus card takes a understood consumer form factor, you don't have to teach a consumer anything, you don't have to worry about whether or not the reader is working at the store, you don't have to worry about the bright lighting in the store, the Wi-Fi is working. You don't have to do any of that. It's a piece of plastic in your hand, and you can chip it, and you can access all of the financial products we can deliver behind it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We think that's going to be a big, big opportunity for accessing offline spend. I think that it won't be a way to acquire new users early. It's the right way to reengage with consumers offline, which is probably the most profitable and thoughtful way to do that, at least initially. Eventually, we'll be able to think about debit plus delivered virtually. But again, I think the magic happens when you can just make peace with the fact that it may be very old school but piece of plastic is an understood form factor that's pretty universally accepted.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Maybe just to build on that. Can you touch on the revenue model for debit plus? How you guys will make money on that product? And do you think it moves the needle on fiscal 23 GMV.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're not giving guidance for fiscal '23. And we haven't included in our guidance yet because it's still very early. This is all I can scale. The numbers get pretty exciting when you think about how top a wallet the card does has become for our most active consumers, almost up to consumers or debit users in their normal life that my favorite thing to do and I encourage all of you to do it, if you're researching the space is to go park yourself at a grocery store, even high-end ones like Whole Foods, go park yourself at the checkout counter and watch what cards people are using. I'm guessing a lot of people in this room are like me, and you have a credit card that you pay off at the end of the month. But a lot of American consumers will take their debit card out, and they'll debit their transactions. And that's really a good indicator for our consumer, they think about debit as paying out and think about credit as pay over time. And that consumer doesn't have to start to make the decision about which card to pull out anymore, they can pull out the one card and that we think is this a lot of confidence in that becoming a more top of wallet card. And therefore it gets really exciting at scale.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The revenue model is interchange on the debit transactions. And then, we bring in a number of additional revenue sources over time, at launch, it'll just be the interchange. Over time, we will be able to deliver interest bearing loans to the card. And obviously, we are excited about what we can do for merchants and brands as well over time and the card.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the fact that it links to the consumers existing checking account makes it much easier to…?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">MichaelLinford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mentioned some cost initiatives earlier about what we would do and one of them is, today we have a mixture of ACH and debit on the payment processing side. One of the features of debit process that will obviously use ACH to sell transactions, which takes some costs out of system, which then we can use to reinvest in some of the features for the consumer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Was there another question in the audience? I don't know if I missed one. Okay. So I guess let's move on and talk about operating profits. You guys said on the latest earnings call you expect to deliver sustained, I think is the word you used sustained operating profitability, starting at the end of fiscal 23. So a year from now, essentially. So maybe just talk about, kind of what went into the decision to announce that to the market, the parts of the cost structure that have the most flexibility in case you need to adjust spending in the event of unforeseen top line softness to stick to that commitment, starting a year or so from now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. I mean, we chose our words carefully, like we always do, because we have very good advisors. And also, because you want to make sure people refer back to it. We said sustained is because we were we were profitable on that pieces last quarter. And not because that was a North Star for us or some sort of imperative. That wasn't something that we did with the intentionality for the purpose of a reported number. And I think that shows you just how close we are. And I think we weren't getting credit for what we believe is a pretty strong underlying cash flow generation in the business that I don't think most folks understood. And so we really wanted to make sure the market understood that. And then we wanted to make sure that that we committed to it in a way that was allowed folks to start to think about where the business was going to get to over the next several years, in light of the current macro environment where I do think investors need some comfort on how we think about the level of spend the business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But if we thought it was unnatural, I wouldn't have said it, we believe that achieving that level of profitability is something that will happen naturally as the business scales. So just as a quick reminder, we talked about it as adjusted operating income, which for us is think about it as a revenue, less transaction costs. And on the margin side, and then you've got three buckets of fixed costs, you've got our sales and marketing costs, our GNA costs and our technology data analytics costs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sales and marketing is a line that we do expect to show a lot of leverage on and that's just because it's so much of our business now is about scaling investments that we've made on our partner side. And being mindful about that penetrated to 6% of U.S. ecommerce now, that number will continue to go up. But it won't go up as fast as revenue. And on the G&amp;A side, there's just G&amp;A it's a post to be leveraged like that. That's it. We went public last year, obviously there's a lot of public company costs that were year-on-year growth, we feel like there's going to be a lot of leverage we can deliver there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And that typically, is actually what we're going to keep investing in, the same earnings call we announced that and that a few weeks prior, we had acquired 100 engineers from a company who wound up operations and fast. And that is like, that's the posture we'll have, we're going to build great products to scale the business and we're not taking our foot off the gas there to really expect that line to continue to grow quickly, although again, not as fast as our growth in our unit economics or our revenue, less transaction costs. And so the only thing about it is, we're not cutting it, we're not making anything unnatural, we are not sacrificing growth, we're just acknowledging what's going to happen anyway. And we're really scaling into that level of profitability.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let's talk about Amazon for a minute. They went live with you guys around November, I think we surely report thanksgiving to about seven months in or so, how is the volumes trended versus what you guys had originally expected up to now, maybe you can talk a little bit more broadly about the evolution of the kind of the relationship on the ground between the two companies? </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I think even internally, we forget just how recent this is, like we've not been live with Amazon and Shopify for a year yet. And I think so much of the excitement for us leading into next year and long-term growth prospects are really scaling and making full benefit of the distribution we already have let alone the new distributors that we keep adding, like our partnership with Stripe that was announced earlier this month.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so I think, a lot of excitement for continuing to scale that relationship, it did go live just before Black Friday. And do only one product, it went live with one product in a way that was very down funnel. For us -- falling down funnel, a funnel is where you see it, when you're browsing the product display page, down funnels all the way at checkout, you get a lot of goodness, the more upwelling you get, Amazon is obviously very thoughtful about the consumer experience and the real estate, they have a funnel. And so we're working with them to find ways to optimize the program.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But I'm pleasantly surprised with the traction that we've had early, both in terms of our ability to print really strong unit economics for a firm, but also deliver a lot of volume. And consumers, have satisfaction happiness. We have to measure and monitor our star rating on Amazon, I think it's true that we're the top-rated payment method on amazon.com. And that's, that's something that's really important to us and Amazon around really creating loved consumer experiences, because what we do is special and really valued by our consumers. And we're glad that showing up and how they look at it. It's obviously not a financial measure. But it's a good measure of the health of the program. And certainly how Amazon would think about it, I think.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I wanted to touch on the regulatory backdrop, too. Last year, the CFPB announced they were collecting data, specifically on the paying for as you guys call it, the split pay market. And that data was submitted, I think March is when it was due. So familiar they're looking at that now. So we'd love your thoughts on what that may result in. And then, more recently, we've heard some rumblings about the CFPB maybe looking at AI-based credit decisioning models, and we'd love to get your perspective there. If you've had any conversations with the CFPB. About that, and just any, you know what your concern level might or might not be there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Linford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's always dangerous to speculate about a very powerful and important regulator, like the CFPB. So I'm going to stay away from trying to predict anything about what they're doing. But I will say is that we are -- we have always put the consumer first in our business, and oftentimes to our detriment and thinking about how we build our business. We don't charge late fees, we think the product like deferred interest harms consumers, so we won't touch it. It's important to us to put truth and lending disclosures on every transaction, because even split pay loans are loans because you give somebody money and they pay you back over time. It's alone. And like you'll don't want to call them that. And we took a view early, that that's what they were and we behaved that way. We think that does serve as well or should serve as well. We think that though, it would I think it's a mistake to think that the CFPB is data request is tied to anything. Super near term, although you gamble will not speculate on where they're at. What I would say is that, I think that they are recognizing that consumers are adopting this product in very large numbers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So it's important as the -- their mandate is important for them to understand what this product is, it's important for them to understand how it works. It's important for them to identify areas where consumers couldn’t be harmed, and I think that's what they're doing. I don't know that they have an agenda beyond that they may, but I think it's important. I think they think it's important and that assessment comes from the fact that like we started the conversation. The fact that Apple is now offering this product means that a regular like the CFPB really needs to understand it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jason Kupferberg</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All right. We got to leave it there. We're out of time.
