Joe, please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Joe Hart</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Brett and thank you to everyone joining us on the call today. This was a record quarter for us. For some time we've been expecting a surge in 5G tower work, and that has clearly occurred. Encouragingly, it happens simultaneous with a boom for our telco segment as well. The result is revenue of nearly $24 million up nearly 90% year-over-year. We expect this encouraging revenue trend to continue based on site awards and a growing pipeline of work [ph].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The progress is not as evident on our bottom line yet, but we have implemented significant cost reduction initiatives to address this. As the 5G work surged, we move quickly to meet the demand. Now that we have more visibility into the schedule our customers expect over the next few months, we have strategically reallocated resources to meet near-term demand and have scale back our backend support infrastructure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The result is approximately $2.4 million in reduced expenses on an annual basis and we should see the initial benefits of these cuts in the current quarter, our third fiscal quarter, which ends in June. I would note that most of the personnel reductions were achieved through natural attrition. So there are no restructuring or severance costs associated with this initiative.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Investors should expect margin expansion and a material improvement in our operating and net losses beginning in the current quarter. We are clearly focused on improving bottom line profitability and not just top line growth. Wireless revenue related to tower work and other aspects of the 5G rollout has already increased by 55% year to date compared to last year, year over year. We expect that it will continue to grow throughout this fiscal year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In fact, all last year, we generated approximately $21 million in wireless revenue and we've generated almost $15 million in just the first six months this year. Our growth continues to be broad-based involving several carriers, including both longstanding customers and new players in the market. The work touches all the regions we service, spread across the center of the United States.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are the leading vendor in several large metropolitan areas. Our pipeline of new projects, meaning work, we have been awarded where we are waiting for purchase orders as permitting is complete, gives us significant confidence that the growth will continue in the near term.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The 5G opportunity represents a multi-year secular trend, not just for tower, but for data centers, technology providers, handset manufacturers and wireless carriers. Each of the carriers are investing tens of millions of dollars in the expansion and the CapEx plans of carriers are public and widely discussed. As this wireless segment quickly expands, we are simultaneously benefiting from other secular trends that are driving strong results in our telco segment. Global supply chain issues and chip shortages continue to impact the market for new telco equipment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition, many people are working from home, requiring an expansion of the telco infrastructure to facilitate a remote workforce. Offices are closing either because of challenges related to the pandemic or often because their workforce is now remote, creating a market for office equipment for us to purchase at attractive prices to refurbish and to resell.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All of these factors make our refurbished equipment sold by Nave and Triton, a more compelling and viable option and the year-to-date performance supports this. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue over $11 million and in fact, the nearly $16 million in telco segment revenue was an all-time record high.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The second quarter telco revenue alone exceeded the revenue for the first six months of last year. And our telco segment is contributing solid and positive contribution margin to our company. We continue to anticipate a leveling off of demand at some point in future quarters as the global supply issues and chip shortages subside, albeit at a somewhat elevated level relative to the recent past. The CEO of Intel was quoted recently as predicting that the global chip shortage may last into 2024.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Overall, we delivered 88% revenue growth in the quarter. Our wireless margins and overall profitability were impacted by the increased spending to ramp up crews and capabilities in advance of the coming demand. But we believe that will improve in the current quarter with further margin expansion as we move through the year, as our business reaches the necessary inflection points, where volume is able to offset fixed costs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At the same time, as we are reducing our fixed costs by $2.4 million annually or $600,000 per quarter, we are committed to delivering a bottom line net profit in the coming quarters.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Rutledge, our CFO to provide a more detailed review of our financial results. Michael, please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Michael Rutledge</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Joe. Consolidated sales increased $11.1 million or 88% to $23.8 million for second quarter from $12.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in sales was due to increases in wireless cells of $3.4 million and increased telco cells of $7.7 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Consolidated gross profit increased $2.6 million to $5.8 million for the quarter compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was due to an increase in our telco segment of $2.6 million and a slight increase in gross profit from the wireless segment. As Joe mentioned, we expect margin expansion, particularly in our wireless segment in the second half of the fiscal year related to our cost reductions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Operating expenses increased $600,000 to $2.8 million for the quarter compared to $2.2 million for the same period last year. The increase reflects the company's investment in its regional growth strategy related to expected 5G in infrastructure growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $93,000 or 2% to $3.9 million for the second quarter from $3.8 million for the same period last year. The increase in SG&amp;A relates primarily to increased selling and commissions expenses to support higher [ph].</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think it is important to note that the SG&amp;A increased less than a $100,000 while revenue increased more than $11 million. Net loss for the quarter was $1.4 million or a loss of $0.11 cents per diluted share based on 13.1 million shares, compared with a net loss of $3.1 million or a loss of $0.25 per diluted share based on 12.4 million shares for the same quarter last year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalence were $3.9 million at March 31 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash was used primarily to fund operations. As of March 31, 2021, the company had net inventories of $5.8 million. We continue to believe we are sufficiently capitalized with appropriate backstops to support near-term business conditions until more normalized business conditions return.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This concludes the financial overview segment of our remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate any questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Josh Casper, a private investor. Your line is open, please. Go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. good morning everyone. Can you hear me?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. Good morning, George.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good morning. Just to start out here, this margin expansion potential, are you pretty much through your wireless backlog that you might have been completing with higher costs associated with them and you're going through process would be much improved because that's over or can you highlight us a little bit more on that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. This is Joe. We launched business in seven geographic markets with a new wireless carrier about nine months ago and the premise for that was that we would get sufficient volume in each market to warrant the investment of two to three headcount to oversee the work in those geographies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The volume didn't actually come through in a couple of those markets. So we decided that we needed to pull back on that investment and really that's the crux of it. Overall, it hasn't affected our backlog. Our backlog for the second half of the year is larger than the backlog for the first half of the year on the Fulton side of the business. So we feel that we're at a more steady, profitable equilibrium state, and that allowed us to then trim the back office support that we had set up for a large wave of work to come suddenly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we've trimmed the expenses. It was a fair bit of headcount, but also involves fleet expenses, fuel per diems, things like that. So it both at the direct margin level, we made improvements in our cost of goods sold and at the same time, the back office support. We consolidated, centralized and made it more efficient.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're in good standing with the customers and we're bringing on additional carrier work by the other big three. So I feel like we're in a more stable manageable, profitable structure at the moment. So I think we're in a much better condition. We had to focus on deploying to lots of markets simultaneously. That is always a bit challenging and we got that back under control, and now we're focused on profitable work at both the gross margin level as well as the operating margin level.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. Okay. And what was impressive as you were in this past quarter with this nice improvement was accomplished with some pretty tough weather across the Midwest and Southwest and I think that that would be in your favor going forward from, in terms of this third quarter that you're in now. My additional question on wireless, can you break down the amount of your volume -- revenue volume that's associated with direct on tower work versus land work?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's all on the tower.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's all on the tower. Oh, okay. So are you -- are there -- I think there was a comment earlier in the opening comments about breaking out and developing more business in terms of other types of work associated with wireless, how long before that kind of work develops?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It comes -- it tends to come in waves depending upon what the carriers are doing. So as the carriers are going on to new sites or new sites for them, there could be some fiber back haul and electrical work that goes along with that, that's on the ground to bring either back haul into the cell site or power into the cell site.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So that just kind of comes hand and glove with really the installation of say an AT&amp;T or a Verizon on a site that they haven't previously been located on. But for right now, we're sticking to what we're good at and what we're already widely deployed at. Future kinds of work will be something that, we'll put in a strategy document that we put out and put it on the website.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I see. Okay. And one last on expanding their business activity. It appears as though there's a lot of concern about the moving electricity throughout the United States on a broader basis that there's shortages starting to show. Is there a possibility that you could end up doing some work in the wireless connection along the way, or is that not a thought on your part?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I don't believe so, George. I think that would be something that the carriers -- their own strategy and risk management departments would be dealing with something like that, that down at our level in the food chain. I don't think that's going to impact us at all because, we can actually stand up and build the sites using generators. We don't need permanent power to get a site built. So I think for, at least in the next 12 months, barring some unforeseen macro political event right, it's not going to have an impact on our business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Casper</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Right. Okay. And a question on the telco side, are there areas of activity that you could potentially look at expanding your base of operations? I know that this chip shortage is a big -- has been an opportunity for a repair of existing equipment. Are there areas in the telco area that you could add to do in the future? Have you thought about that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. I think different -- representing different OEM equipment some different types of equipment we've made communications tends to deal in the public switched network and transport networks and Triton Datacom deals with enterprise networks or office communication products, both of those Presidents Mike Birch and Damon Selector [ph] are looking at ways of expanding both in product lines, as well as with different OEMs and with new customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">One of the, I'll say previous issues we had was that with restricted cash resources, we were basically inhibiting any rapid growth for both of those companies, but when Michael Rutledge was able to convert our banking facility with a vast bank out of Oklahoma, we have $19 million worth of capacity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we're in a different situation now and he and the fellows running Navy and Triton are really now able to approach it with a much more aggressive mindset. So we feel very bullish about our ability to continue to grow the telco segment while we're going through this wireless growth period with 5G. So I think we're in a good spot and now really the job for Michael and I is to get this business on a profitable standing right now in this current quarter and moving forward and that's what Michael and I are focused on</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Michael Rutledge</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in closing, I just an observation, the revenue stream of the past quarter and what you've got the momentum you've got going here in this existing quarter you're going to be reaching toward hopefully being able to deliver a $100 million in revenue stream on a annual basis going forward as you build out. And that's pretty impressive with a company with what 13 million shares out and selling at a little more than a $1 a share. If you get this bottom line built up, there should -- the shareholders should be able to enjoy something they've been waiting for, for a long time at the bottom line. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, George.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator instructions] [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">UnidentifiedAnalyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi guys. I apologize. I got I'm a little late in case this has been going over, but your telco segment, did you have a build up of inventory to enable you to have this kind of sales? Or can you keep that up? Do you have the ability to get inventory to move it, or are you selling it down to where you won't have the inventory as the quarters go by here?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We did not add to inventory. We did buy products that were available on the market. In some ways we sell from inventory. Other ways, we're a bit of a broker and we'll find the need from a client and then go find the source for the product, and then we'll match those two things together and make the sale.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So we're really focused on not building inventory that has been a problem in past years. And I'll say three to five years ago that was a problem. We've worked hard collectively as a management team to get that in control. So I don't see anything inhibiting us from growing the telco business in a very strong fashion for the next couple years. Now, I am not in charge of the global chip shortage or supply chain issues from Asia or anything like that, but both of those events actually help our business for Nave and Triton.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">UnidentifiedAnalyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, exactly. So you, I assume you'd have a lot higher margin on selling your inventory than being the broker.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, we would.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">UnidentifiedAnalyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Joe Hart</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">You're welcome.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator instructions] It appear there are no further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back to the management for any additional or closing remarks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Joe Hart</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, operator. This is Joe again. We're clearly focused on getting this company in a profitable situation and doing it this year and quickly. The $2.4 million cost reduction is the beginning of it; will continue to shape and trim the back office and support structure to both enable the growth of our business, but at the same time not be overspending or overcommitting on that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I consider it a work in progress, but it has -- Michael and myself, that is our total focus to get this in a positive net income perspective on a quarter-over-quarter basis, moving forward. Those actions are in place already. We finished Q2 strong and had an excellent March and an even better April. We feel that the trends are in place and the metrics are in place to make this a place worth investing in once again. So thank you for your continued interest and your support and we feel a strong obligation to return that support to you.
