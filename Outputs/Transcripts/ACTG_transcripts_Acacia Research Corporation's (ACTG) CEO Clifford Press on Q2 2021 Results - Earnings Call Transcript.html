Clifford and Al will provide a business update and Rich will review the quarterly financial results.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">With all that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Clifford Press. Mr. Press, the call is<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> yours.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Clifford Press</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. At the end of the second quarter, our capital base consisting of cash, private and public investments, and availability pursuant to our partnership with Starboard Value LP stood at $770 million. We continue to pursue acquisitions of operating businesses through a tightly coordinated research process, leveraging our team’s experience in public and private markets.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We focus on mature technology Life Sciences, Healthcare and Industrials, and certain segments of Financial Services including Insurance. Our primary opportunity set remains with companies that are sub-$2 billion in equity market cap. As we have said in the past, we view this segment as the least efficient area of the public markets and when the favors our primary research approach and permanent capital structure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have now position Acacia in an opportune part of the market. Specifically, we operate at the interface between private and public market valuations, making us an ideal partner for a variety of sellers and investors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are able to deploy permanent capital to navigate complex multi-factor transactions. We are a corporate acquirer and are opposition to be an attractive packet counterparties, such as private equity funds and large enterprises. This approach leverages our rigorous investment process with Starboard, strong balance sheet and ready access to committed capital.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have active relationships with private equity investors, who may find underperforming public companies where our involvement can be constructive and will continue to build this network.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In summary, we remain committed to our strategy, which benefits from the inherent flexibility we have created, enabling us to pursue a range of potential transactions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I will now turn the call over to Al Tobia, our Chief Investment Officer to speak to our existing holdings. Al?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Al Tobia</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Clifford. As we evaluate new opportunities, we continue to maximize the value and return of our existing holdings. Our goal is to monetize our Life Sciences portfolio expeditiously. During the second quarter, we exited our position in Sensign [ph] and to-date we have now recovered $212 million of our original $282 million Life Science portfolio investment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a reminder, immediately following the acquisition of this portfolio, we recovered approximately $145 million through the sale of certain public equities from the portfolio. We have continued to monetize this portfolio, and as of June 30th, we held positions in two public companies, Arix Bioscience and Induction Healthcare Group, and these positions represented approximately $66.7 million in value.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Immunocore recently completed an IPO, though our class of shares did not yet trade publicly as of June 30th. Importantly, we continue to hold meaningful positions in four additional private Life Sciences companies, including Oxford Nanopore Technologies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oxford Nanopore disclosed earlier this year that it state -- started the process of preparing for an IPO and that while the timing of the potential IPO is dependent on market conditions and other matters not fully within its control, Oxford Nanopore expects that the IPO would occur on the second half of 2021 on the London Stock Exchange. In addition to Oxford Nanopore, we remain enthusiastic about the prospects for our other private holdings.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With respect to our IP business, investments made over the past year have resulted in a balanced portfolio, including both soft licensing and litigation. We generated more than $17 million in revenue this year, up from $2 million in the second quarter last year. This growth was driven by a few licenses and settlements, including one large settlement.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our policy is not to comment publicly on the specifics of any individual settlement, including identifying counterparties given confidentiality agreements and other considerations. Our team is actively advancing a number of opportunities to monetize our existing IP assets and to acquire additional portfolios.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Rich Rosenstein, our CFO to discuss the results. Rich?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Rich Rosenstein</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Al. Our book value at June 30, 2021, was $147.1 million or $3.02 per basic share, compared to $128.1 million or $2.64 per basic share at March 31st, and $292.5 million or $5.94 per basic share at December 31, 2020. Our book value reflects the impact of the increase in the company’s share price over the last year on our warrant and embedded derivatives liabilities, which stood at $290.2 million at June 30th.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As these liabilities would be extinguished upon exercise or exploration of these warrants and prefers, we consider their impact should all derivatives be converted. Assuming full exercise of all issued derivatives, Acacia pro forma book value would rise to $942.8 billion or $5.70 per share, up from $882.5 billion or $5.39 per share on the same basis as of December 31, 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the quarter highlights of our financial performance include the following. Revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $17.4 million, up from $2.1 million a year ago. Operating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, reversing a loss of $6.7 million a year ago. Realized and unrealized gains total $25.8 million in the quarter. Cash and equity securities at fair value totaled $320.6 million at June 30, 2021, compared to $274.6 million at December 31st. Debt was $145.5 million in senior secured notes issued to Starboard Value. More detail on these results have been made available in the press release issued this morning and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which we filed with the SEC this morning.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let me now turn the call back to Clifford for closing comments. Clifford?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Clifford Press</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Rich. In conclusion, Acacia continues to execute on its investment strategy. As always, our focus continues to be on improvement in our book value and executing our acquisition strategy, which we are focused on doing in collaboration with Starboard. As stewards of shareholder capital with the valuation fit and a variety of other factors and important -- factors as important and we will not rest to make an acquisition for expedience.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are now happy to answer questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions for you. Most recently you sell a patent litigation with a network equipment supplier. Can you confirm that your June revenues were impacted by the settlement and could we expect kind of monies going forward then I have a couple other questions after that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Rich, why don’t you take that one?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Rich Rosenstein</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. Yeah. I can. So, Tony, as we mentioned, our revenues in the quarter were just over $17 million and did include a number of license agreements and settlements, including one large settlement. And so that you’ll see on our balance sheet as accounts receivable that we would have collected in the beginning of the third quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Do you expect that to continue Rich or is it a kind of one and done settlement?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Rich Rosenstein</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As Al had mentioned, we can’t comment on the specifics of individual settlements, but many of our licensing agreements and settlements are often upfront, look, involved upfront payment, some do have recurring revenue characteristics to them, but by and large, our transactions are typically upfront payments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Tony, it’s Clifford. I’ll just add on that, that we’ve got some new portfolios that are coming to realization. Now, we regard that settlement as an auspicious start for that portfolio and we expect a substantial follow on for that portfolio.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Meaning with other companies Clifford or with the same existing…</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With other licenses?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then shifting gears, your Viamet JV, your partner is valuing their ownership in Viamet at a much higher valuation than you guys are. Can you discuss why and maybe the differences and what they’re currently valued at versus what you are and why you guys aren’t? I guess maybe why you are valuing it more conservatively?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. There is two</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Rich Rosenstein</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. I can…</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, Rich, can -- Rich will describe the GAAP aspect of it first and I’ll talk about the underlying investment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Rich Rosenstein</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. Thank you, Clifford. So, Tony, you’re right, we -- as we indicated at our press release, we value several of our private company positions Viamet Pharmaceuticals included on cost -- on the basis of cost. And we have adopted an approach to valuing our private securities using what’s called the measurement alternative under ASC 321 and that involves valuing the privates at initial cost.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We then adjust for any impairment that might be -- that might have taken place. And then we will also adjust for any observed transactions either primary or secondary transactions in the underlying issue or shares, whether they’d be the same shares that we hold, different class of shares, different size of amount that we own, we’ll take all of that into consideration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">There has been no observed transactions environment per se and so we’re -- we continue to carry that as at cost and you can see in our release the three of our private positions Viamet Pharmaceuticals, AMO Pharma and NovaBiotics were carrying at on a GAAP basis, we’re carrying at a value combined of $25.4 million. So we’re not adopt -- we have not adopted a fair value approach to each of our private holdings.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And then, shifting gear…</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I will say -- just to finish on your question about the difference in evaluation, which explained, while we do not disagree with the Melan [ph] valuation, that product is a pretty significant advance for in women’s health, that drug and we do think that Melan have a viable basis for recording their valuation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. And Clifford, I have a bigger picture one and I know you and I applaud the fact that you don’t want to rush into just any acquisition, but the partnership with Starboard going on almost a year and a half, with no acquisitions to show yet. I know you guys have been working hard. Any color either you’ve been out bid or you -- you’re very active now or you think you’re getting closer now, anything would be helpful, because I continue to get lots of calls from shareholders wondering, a year and a half in while we still don’t have anything to show yet?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. It’s a legitimate question and the anyway we really like to answer it is with some transactions, which we’re getting close to. But in terms of where we’ve been so far, because Starboard were extremely instrumental in doing the Woodford portfolio acquisition, which is -- and we’ve recently spent a substantial amount of time in due diligence on a public company of significant size and decided at the end, it still did not meet our criteria. However, we have a very robust pipeline of late-stage prospects at the moment and I’d be surprised, as I’ve said before, if we don’t have some significant transactions and come completed by the end of the day.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Anthony Stoss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Thanks for that. Thanks, guys.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">[Operator Instructions] And next we go to the line of Brett Reiss with Janney. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good morning, gentlemen.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hello, Brett.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">First question is it still the company’s aspiration to generate $3 to $4 of revenue on the $42.4 million patent net of accumulated amortization?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Not sure where that, where we got those numbers from, Brett. We don’t generally refer to that type of investment in terms of revenue. We refer to it in terms of where we expect to build book value over time and we will continue to emphasize that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Rich Rosenstein</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Brett, just, I think, maybe what you -- when you’re referring to that, I think, that may be, if we decide to partner with someone and there’s a back end, when you look at some of these transactions, there’s a larger kind of revenue component and then there’s a profit share, maybe that’s where the $3 to $4 came from.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But to Clifford’s point, each one of these deals has its own criteria. So we’re not that prescriptive on $3 to $4 per book value. We look at things in terms of their ability to generate a targeted return that we believe is acceptable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. There’s all sorts of estimates all over the map on what the IPO value of the Oxford Nanopore might be? What do you think the IPO value of Oxford Nanopore is going to be?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Brett, I don’t think it’ll surprise you if I tell you that, it’s an active IPO. We’re top five shareholder and it just would not be appropriate for us to make any comment whatsoever in that regard.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Fair enough. One last one and it’s really just asking the question, again, from the prior color, in terms of on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being metaphysical certainty and one being it’s just not going to happen. What is the probability of a deal being consummated for on an operating company before calendar year 2021 is up?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Clifford Press</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Brett, you have been around for a long time and you know deals? So, I think it’s -- it would be, nobody would feel comfortable predicting with certainty, any transaction until it’s happened. But what we can tell you with certainty is that we’re working very hard. We have a tremendous research collaboration with Starboard and there are a number of transactions that we’re looking at very closely.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brett Reiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you for taking my questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next we go to the line of Kevin Sami with Sami Capital.
