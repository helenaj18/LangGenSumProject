And welcome everyone. Good evening to those in America. We appreciate everyone's time. We are pleased to have gotten off to a strong start to the year, reporting a 41.6% increase in terms of student enrollment to 964 students in the first quarter of the year. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the promising sign that we are fully in the post-pandemic recovery we saw significant year-over-year growth across our major programs, portfolio training, overseas study counselling, research-based learning and foreign language training. Our primary offering in the portfolio training program in-built 528 students during the period, an increase of 30.7% from 4.04% in the same period last year. Credit hours benefit for portfolio training increased 5.5% to 27,865.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Having rising to meet the challenges of the 2020 pandemic, which will give us an opportunity to reinforce the foundation of our business and explore additional growth areas. We are gratified to begin realizing some of the tangible results of these efforts here in the first quarter of 2021, which is generally impacted by some seasonality due to the Chinese Spring Festival holiday.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We are hopeful that the road to recovery will continue on a positive trajectory as vaccinations against COVID-19 progress globally. At this time, we are working closely with our overseas partners’ institutions to [indiscernible] our summer programs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Given the current circumstances of the global pandemic, we have determined with our partners to offer alternative programming to students this summer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">International travel continues to be in a place of uncertainty and we feel this is the best way to maintain the health and safety of our students. We are pleased to be offering domestic learning experiences in China, as well as various online bootcamps in partnership with overseas institutions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that let's look to financials for the quarter. Total net revenues for the first quarter of 2021 increased 15% to RMB37.6 million from RMB32.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. This top line improvement was primarily driven by an overall increase in services delivered across our major programs as we continues to recover in the post-pandemic environment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross margin was 39.6% during the 2021 first quarter up from 35.8% in the prior-year period. Net loss attributable to ACG improved to RMB19 million, from RMB20.5 million in the prior year period. This was primarily a result of an approximate RMB3.2 million improvement in loss from operations during the period, which was offset by an RMB1.7 million in reduced benefit from non-redeemable non-controlling interests.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to be in a solid financial position with US$14.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Working capital deficits was US$26.5 million and total shareholders’ equity was US$27.2 at March 31, 2021, compared to working capital deficit of US$23.6 million and shareholders’ equity of US$30.5 respectively at December 31, 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would now like to turn it over to Kevin who will expand upon our outlook and growth strategy. Kevin?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Kevin Ma</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Amy. We are extremely pleased to see that turnaround demonstrated by the elements we achieve that during the first quarter of 2021.

It’s a very promising start to the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As the public health situation in China remain stable over the past several months. We are optimistic that this [indiscernible] will continue over the course of the year, the more and more of the global population and vaccinated against the COVID-19 and the way maintain this have to a poster demand recovery.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This will be aided about our – you centralize the system for monitoring sales leads as well as when you are offering we have matched in the past year. ACG’s stellar reputation has been applicable by the consistent courage of our curriculum and the teaching staff as well as a positive outcomes we have hear the students who are pursuing creative study achieve. This is regarding of where coursework is delivered in-person or online. Our mission is to provide students with all the tools and the support that they need for success at ACG. And then we are better equipped to deliver on this promise than before.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In the post-pandemic, I believe most everyone’s looking to take advantage of real world experience, where we can fully interact with one another face to face. It’s partnering is an excellent match offer a great deal of less speed, but we can’t experience the place if you don’t actually go there in person. That being said, many students continue to be interested in pursue study abroad and we are prepared to meet that demand when it’s safe to do so.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As Andy mentioned, it’s I like that we’ll be offering international study abroad programs, it’s our partner is fishing has decided this is a better path forward and the current circumstance, we are pleased with that students and enjoying the new domestic travel programs and online bootcamp alternatives we have developed and look forward to us again, working with our partners to make those options available this summer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’d now like to hand the floor over to Jun Zhang, ACG's President, to provide an update on our current growth initiatives.
