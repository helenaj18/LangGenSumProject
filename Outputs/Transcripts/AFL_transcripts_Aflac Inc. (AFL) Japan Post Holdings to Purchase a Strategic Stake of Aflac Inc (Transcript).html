Your lines have been placed in listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised today’s conference is being recorded.</p> <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice-President of Aflac Investor &amp; Rating Agency Relations</p> <p><strong>David Young</strong></p> <p>Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our call. This morning, we are hosting a short 30 minute call. The first 10 minutes of which will be prepared remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated; followed by Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director of Aflac Life Insurance Japan; and Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Aflac Incorporated. We will then open up our call for 20 minutes of Q&amp;A with members of our executive management team in both Japan and the U.S. who are listed on this morning’s press release.</p> <p class="iS_EF">Before we begin, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although, we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. This morning’s press release and related Form 8-K are available on investors.aflac.com where you will also find other financial materials and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">I’ll now hand the call<span class="paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible"> over to Dan. Dan?</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Dan Amos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, David. Good morning and good evening from Japan. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to announce the strategic alliance between Japan Post Holding, Aflac Incorporated and Aflac Japan. This strategic alliance expands on our existing relationships that began a decade ago and represent an unprecedented opportunity. It is designed to create a sustained cycle of growth for our company, so that Aflac’s growth will contribute to Japan Post Holdings earnings. But our agreement does not include Aflac Incorporated or any of its subsidiaries becoming Japan Post Group companies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our announcement and the framework of the alliance include three important components. First, it includes an investment by Japan Post in Aflac Incorporated common shares. And Fred will cover the detail shortly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let me just say that I’m very pleased to gain Japan Post Holding as a long-term investor that believes in the future growth of Aflac Incorporated. Second, we are reaffirming our existing cancer insurance distribution alliance and related sales initiatives. Today, Aflac Japan’s cancer insurance is sold throughout Japan in more than 20,000 post offices and 76 sales offices directly managed by Japan Post Insurance. In fact, this year, we are on pace to achieve over ¥20 billion in cancer insurance sales, which represents nearly 25% of Aflac Japan’s third sector sales. This success would not be possible without the combined strength and scale of both companies and having earned the trust of our mutual customers and policyholders. Finally, when we consider the additional business expansion initiatives, that could be mutually beneficial.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now I'll turn it off to Koide-san to discuss the new aspects of the alliance in greater detail. Koide?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Masatoshi Koide</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Dan. I will focus my attention on the existing and expanded business alliance between Aflac Japan and the Japan Post Holdings. First, this announcement based on important reaffirmation of consolidated initiatives between the Japan Post Holdings, Japan Post, Japan Post Insurance and Aflac Japan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To expand upon what Dan shared, our agreement includes commitment to cancer insurance products and the customer-centric business management. Aflac Japan and Japan Post have committed to efforts to further develop cancer insurance as an important product in the three Japan Post Group companies' sales strategies, and have created our mutual commitment through the alliance and importance of cancer insurance to our respective franchises. It also includes positioning cancer insurance as an important product within the three Japan Post companies, setting sales targets and associated promotions. Additionally, it includes agency services provided by Japan Post and Japan Post Insurance as well as training support services provided by Japan Post Insurance</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Furthermore, it includes renewed commitment through the existing the insurance agreement between Japan Post Insurance and Aflac Japan on cancer insurance. Finally, this agreement further expands our mutual commitment to join forces and build awareness of the importance of cancer education, cancer screening, early detection and the sponsorship of cancer philanthropic efforts. While the expanded business alliance agreement also focuses on new initiatives, expansion and growth, most specific business initiatives have been advanced to the point of disclosure. Both parties have identified areas of potential development and are committed to exploring joint expansion opportunities, which include leveraging digital technology to improve the customer experience, incorporating a new product to development, investing jointly in third-party entities, expanding business in Japan and overseas and utilizing Aflac Global Investments for certain assets management opportunities. While we do not have details to share regarding these areas of expanded focus today, we would expect that discussions to develop throughout the year and to share more in the future. I joined Dan and the rest of our team in our enthusiasm for driving the business alliance forward and jointly creating value for our mutual shareholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let me now turn the call over to Fred.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Fred Crawford</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Koide-san. An essential part of our business partnership is aligning economic interest such that both parties can participate in the future success of the alliance beyond premium and commissions. Aligning economic interest is accomplished through Japan Post Holdings intent to purchase through a trust approximately 7% of our outstanding shares in the open market beginning in early 2019.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To be very clear, the investment of Japan Post Holdings in Aflac’s common shares does not contemplate the issuance of new shares is not a capital raise and is not dilutive to current Aflac shareholders. The open market acquisition of shares by Japan Post Holdings will not disrupt our share repurchase plans and guidance for 2019, which remains an estimated range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. Recognizing Japan Post Holdings is approximately 60% owned by the Japanese Government, Aflac shares will be purchased through a trust structure with an appointed trustee charged with voting the shares. As a partial state-owned entity, this approach creates separation between government ownership of Japan Post Holdings and owning and voting Aflac shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The acquisition of shares by Japan Post Holdings is governed by a shareholder agreement, which contains provisions for a strategic minority investment in Aflac Incorporated. I would highlight the following. The agreement includes a cap on ownership of 10% of shares and a minimum holding level or lockup as certain target ownership thresholds are achieved. Once the independent trust holds the stock for 48 consecutive months as with all of our investors, the shares qualify for 10-for-1 voting rights. Our shareholder approved 10-for-1 provision allows Japan Post Holdings to achieve a minimum of 20% voting rights in year five of ownership. 20% voting rights is important to Japan Post Holdings as they desire to achieve equity method accounting such that they can recognize a portion of Aflac Incorporated results in their financial statements. For example, in the case of owning approximately 7% of our stock, 7% of our financial results would be recognized in Japan Post Holdings results.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The agreement includes certain stand still and voting guidelines that limit control. Pro rata voting in other words voting in proportion with other shareholders is required for any votes above 20%. From vote number one, pro rata is required on matters related to change the control among other affirmative restrictions on intervening in board or manager matters of significance. In all other cases, the ability to vote shares up to 20% of Aflac outstanding voting rights, including in board elections, remains.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The purchase of Aflac shares and related structure is subject to regulatory approvals both in Japan and the U.S. Japan Post Holdings intense to purchase less than 10% of Aflac's common stock. However, the U.S. State Regulatory Form A process in our States of Domicile is still required as the long-term intend is to hold the shares and qualify for 10 for 1 voting rights. We believe we have an acceptable structure, but there can be no assurances until we are through the process given the unique nature of the parties and the alliance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Let me now hand back to Dan for a few final comments on the announcement. Dan?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Dan Amos</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, let me close by saying that I could not be more proud to partner with such a well-respected company as Japan Post Holdings. I’m deeply honored that Japan Post use Aflac as an attractive long-term investment poised for the future growth. I have spent quality time with Japan Post CEO, Nagato-san, and I know he would share my view that the most important metric that defines the success of our alliance is the over 16,000 individual payments totaling more than ¥13 billion in claims paid through our mutual clients and policy holders. We look forward to supporting the many policyholders and customers of our respective organizations and building mutual shareholder value in the process.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Now, I’ll hand the call back over to David for Q&amp;A. David?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>David Young</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Dan. This is a shorter timeframe for today’s call. Please limit yourself to one question. After which your line will be placed on mute. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we will now take the first question.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. We will now begin question-and-answer session. It came from the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Nadel</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I guess if I’m limited to one question, it would be this. Last week, I think, when the initial announcement was -- whether it was leaked or otherwise, press reports indicated that Japan Post was going to cap their investment in dollar terms at about $2.65 billion. This morning the announcement talked about 7% of shares. Is there still a relationship between the dollar amounts that they’re willing to invest versus the percentage?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This is Fred. The way I would answer that is the intent is to purchase up to 7% of the outstanding shares, and if you do the math on that, just assuming, for example, just around 775 million shares outstanding, and then multiply by the share price and convert it to yen. Some of the news reports that I’ve seen have it about right. They’ve been pegging it at roughly ¥270 billion investment over time on the part of Japan Post. And I think that would equate more in the range of $2.4 billion. But obviously the most important thing to understand is that they’ll be buying this in the open market and they'll be buying it over a year’s timeframe. So of course, the total investment is yet to be determined as they'll be buying over a period of time, and the stock price will obviously move with that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Unidentified Company Representative </span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And John, I'd just add if you want another question, just hit star one and get back in the queue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Next question came from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Ryan Krueger</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I was just hoping you could confirm, I believe, this is the case from the 8-K. But will the open market purchases begin now or do they need to wait until the regulatory approval has been given?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. It’s a good question. The beginning of purchasing of stock needs to wait until the trust is put in place. And Japan Post, as beneficiary owner, intends to put the trust in place in the first couple of months of the New Year. And so we would expect the trust to be in place by the end of February. After that trust in place -- is in place, they’re free to begin buying the stock. Obviously, their ability to buy up to the 7% and hold the stock over the long-term is subject to regulatory approval, but they can't commence buying the stock once the trust structure is in place. They cannot begin buying the stock until the trust is in place that is the vehicle for regulatory purposes that will be owning and ultimately voting the stock.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Next question is from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Suneet Kamath</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Could you just provide some detail around how this came about? Is this something that you guys went to Japan Post with or did they reach out to you guys? Just any call there would be helpful.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Amos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I’ll answer that. We have an annual meeting with top management, specifically, me and Nagato as well as other top management people Charles and Koide and Fred. And he brought it up to me in May. And so it was -- it came from them and we liked it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Next question is from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Alex Scott</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The question I had is just related to the commentary on global expansion and potential investments and JVs with third-party entities. I think, in the past, you guys have talked about traditional M&amp;A, and maybe global expansion outside of the U.S. and Japan is something that wasn't necessarily a key priority. I mean, does this change that? Would you expect that that's the direction this is going that you may try to expand out of the market you're in currently and do something more transformative here?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Amos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I don't think at this particular time that's the case. Of course, we're always looking, we've said that. But one of the things that this agreement does is puts in place a long-term relationship with us in Japan Post, which is the most important thing. Other aspects of it will be something that would fall under Fred's purview of looking on an international basis and we'll have to take that later on. But that's not high on the agenda right now. Other products to expand to -- other things to do within Japan are first, but certainly, we will be looking, but that will not be our strength nor should it be.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. And I, Alex, I would add that Dan is absolutely right. And this does not change any of our filtering and framework and strategy around what we would be interested in and are not interested in terms of expanding, whether it'd be domestically or overseas. All it really means is that there may be opportunities where the strategic expansion efforts and strategy of Japan Post Holdings and the same efforts at Aflac across each other or overlap. And if that's the case, we may be wise to work together to pursue opportunities. But there's nothing identified. This is all going to be really in the planning stage as we move forward.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Next question is from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Thomas Gallagher</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The 10% maximum position in the limitation to 20% voting rights after 4 years, are those permanent limits? Or is there a timeline for that agreement?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Those guidelines are in place as long as the trust is in place and the shares are owned. The only provision that you'll see in the agreement is that once the 10-for-1 is in place and the four years takes place, because Japan Post desires reaching the 20% voting, there is flexibility in their ability to buy shares in order to satisfy the 20% voting, which gets them the equity method accounting. But we think that's very likely to be at or below 10% of the shares regardless. So the cap remains in place. There is a bit of flexibility at the end of the four years that's allowed, but they remain in place while the agreement is in place.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Next question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Mark Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Are there products that Japan Post now distributes that you could potentially manufacture yourself something you may not do at this point, but given the scale that Japan Post would allow you, you might go ahead and launch some new products and the distribution would be shifted over to you. Anything like that contemplated?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Masatoshi Koide</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. The Japan Post itself is distributing various products. Of course, Aflac Japan has a capacity to develop those products as well. But under the new strategic alliance agreement, we agreed to consider new product development. At this moment there is nothing specific products in another agreement.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Another question is from John Nadel of UBS. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">John Nadel</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oh, how about that. My second question was just going to be, now that there is a bit more formality to the relationship, particularly as Post built its equity stake. I was just wondering if you given any consideration between the companies, yours and Post. Whether you would split out for us the actual contribution of your sales that’s coming from the post relationship?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Amos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I gave it to you. It’s 25% of the total sales, a third sector sales came from Japan Post. And you put a number to it and get what the cancer insurance is.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah. And John, what I would add to that too is that if what you're asking is of a more technical nature, for example, what we’ll be breaking out Japan Post results, for example, on our statistical supplement or quarterly supplement. The intent would be not to do that for the simple fact that we do not break out individual distribution arrangements. However, both parties have agreed as part of this alliance that we will be furnishing, if you will, and publicly commenting on the performance of the alliance in the way of sales results. So you will get the results from us. We’ll comment on it. We’ll answer questions on it. But we’re likely – not likely to break it out at this time in our statistical supplements.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Another question is from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Suneet Kamath</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I know its early days, but as we think about kind of the long-term story at Aflac, are there any changes to kind of your growth expectations or mix of capital deployment between dividend and buybacks as a result of this?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No, there is not. We have a 36-year track record of dividend increase. That is in part what Japan Post in addition to the alliance finds very attractive about the investments that they’re making in our stock. And so interests are certainly align there. And it doesn’t change our views on allocation of capital. We reaffirmed, if you will, this morning, our intent to buy back stock according to our outlook. And again, our decisions around allocation of capital remain the same as what we discussed in the outlook call. Ultimately, we’re seeking a very best return for our shareholders with that excess capital.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Another question came from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW.

I believe Japan Post sells other company's medical products. As part of the new alliance, is there the potential that they could start distributing Aflac’s medical products to the post offices?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Masatoshi Koide</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Japan Post is now setting the medical lineup. Due to the Japanese regulatory framework the Japan Post insurance cannot provide medical -- standalone medical insurance to our Japan Post. As I said that under the new strategic alliance agreement, we agreed to consider to new product development, but nothing is specified at this moment. We will work together to consider the future opportunity to develop new product.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next question is from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Alex Scott</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks for taking the follow-up question. I was just interested in the timing. I understand the timing of how the 7% stake will come in over time. I guess the collaboration on products and some of the things that are going on, will that start immediately? Or will that need to wait until the investments in place? And then also if you can provide any information on just the potential for asset management and any kind of incremental fees you can get from that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Dan Amos</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It’ll start immediately. Fred, you want to take the asset?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then on asset manager, right now we’ve -- both parties have just agreed to pursue mutual opportunities that leverage Aflac Global Investments. There’s been no timeframe or specific mandates identified at this time. So just as Dan said, planning and strategizing will commence now with the closing of this alliance and signing today, but there’s no specific plans at this point.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next question is from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Tom Gallagher</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Just a question on the cancer products that you are selling through Japan Post and how that might change overtime here. I think my understanding is up until now the main product being sold through Japan Post on the cancer side with small face amount with minimal coverage. Are you able to go larger face amount, larger policy size? Will anything like that change?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Masatoshi Koide</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Japan Post is now selling cancer product to, which is the same, the other -- our industry is selling. So Japan Post is now selling the full size of our cancer insurance products. So then when Aflac Japan renews our cancer insurance, Japan Post adopted such new cancer insurance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Next question is from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Mark Dwelle</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Just kind of a mechanics question. I understand they’ll start out at 7%, and I understand that they’re capped at 10%. Won’t they reach a point where Aflac would be somewhat precluded from doing further share buybacks because it would push their ownership above 10%?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Fred Crawford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">They are -- yes, that can take place. In other words, you’ll notice that they are targeting 7% ownership, but the cap is at 10%. Part of that difference is to, in fact, absorb our ability to buy back shares over time where they naturally will increase their ownership level. But there are provisions in the shareholder agreement that if by virtue of our buyback activity, their share ownership exceeds the ownership cap, then they are required to sell down to that cap to stay below it. And then there's mechanics as to the selling down. I should note that this is being done in the open market as is mentioned in the press release, but also more, specifically there are volume restrictions as to how it's done. So for example, Japan Post is limited to 15% of the daily volume and our stock as they acquire shares, over and above that, however, they can do block trades to accumulate the shares more quickly. And then on selling down, should there be a need to sell down to remain within the caps? There are similar guidelines for selling down where the movement down in shares would be limited to 15% of the volume. So it's meant to be -- to calm down if you will any movement in the stock by virtue of supplying and demand of shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>David Young</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All right. And I believe that is our last call. So just before we end I'd like to remind everyone that while we have had preliminary dialogue with our U.S. state of domicile regulators as well as the FSA in Japan, this strategic investment is subject to certain regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance of success. However, we believe we have an acceptable structure in place.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, please feel free to contact our investor and rating agency relations department with any questions. I'd also like to remind you of our fourth quarter earnings release on January 31<sup>st</sup> and teleconference on February 1<sup>st</sup>. Until then, we wish you a Happy Holidays, and thank you for joining the call this morning.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That concludes today's conference call.
