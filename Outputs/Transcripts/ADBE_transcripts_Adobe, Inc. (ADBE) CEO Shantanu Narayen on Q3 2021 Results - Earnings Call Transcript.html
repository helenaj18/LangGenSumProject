As anticipated, with regions beginning to reopen across the globe. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We saw pronounced summer seasonality in Q3. This is consistent with the experience of businesses across industries, as evidenced by data from the Adobe digital index, which showed that June and July marked the highest consumer travel season in two years. This correlated with lower web traffic while individuals enjoyed their summer holidays. We do see continued recovery in the SMB segment associated with the reopening. We achieved Creative revenue of 2.37 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. And we added 348 million of net new Creative ARR.

Increasing unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally strengthened new licensing and renewal for our Acrobat for teams offering in the SMB segment and continued adoption of our Acrobat web and the Acrobat mobile offerings. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our Digital Experience segment in Q3, we achieved revenue of $985 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Digital experience subscription revenue was 864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. We continue to see subscription revenue acceleration in digital experience as large and mid-sized enterprises increased their investments in customer experience management.

Merchant services growth through new strategic partnerships, increasing adoption of our Workfront and Customer Journey Management offerings. Strong customer retention as we focus relentlessly, a value realization for our customers and demand for Adobe's professional services. Operating expenses increased in Q3 as we continue to make strategic investments and increased headcount. We began to reopen our facilities and return to moderate levels of business travel. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The majority of our employees continue to work from home, while the return to business travel is expected to ramp slowly. And we expect to further ramp our hiring in Q4. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused a sequential currency increase to revenue of $10 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused the currency increase to revenue of $80 million. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The sequential reduction in our GAAP tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tax accrued on foreign earnings and tax benefits associated with share-based payment. That's our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 37 days in the year-ago quarter and 35 days last quarter. RPO grew by 22% year-over-year to 12.63 billion exiting Q3 benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was 6.16 billion cash flow from operations in Q3 were 1.42 billion sequentially down from Q2 due to increases in prepaid expenses, income tax payments, and a decrease in accrued expenses. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $1 billion. We currently have $14.1 billion remaining of our $15 billion authority granted in December 2020, Q4 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions, and typical year-end seasonal strength, including an expected increase in back-to-school spending and year-end enterprise licensing strength.

With the massive opportunities across creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management, we continue to invest and drive strong business results. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions].We'll take our first question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just -- can we double-click on the seasonality commentary in the quarter? Because if we look at the beat versus guidance on net new digital media ARR, it looks, at the same time you had the weakest beat, but then the strongest guide in the last three years, which kind of speaks to and confirm some of those seasonality comments that you made. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But can we just dive in to get a better sense of exactly what drove that for the Creative Cloud business? And then separately, what you're seeing in the enterprise adoption, particularly around AEP and on the CDP front, that's driving some of the really strong guidance there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Happy to do that, Alex. So first on your DME question, as it related to the ARR. Overall, we were pleased and I think it really speaks to the strength of our DDOM and the insights that we get associated with the business. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think going into the quarter, we had expected that the consumer with a little bit more return to normalcy as what's happening in the environment. Now, this may have been a little prior to the Delta Variant that we expected travel to increase and therefore, as a result, as summer seasonality and summer holidays was really sort of a two-year time off from what they had to do. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So as expected, we saw a little bit of less web traffic on that particular front. The SMB was a highlight for us. SMB, which was impacted a little bit more we're continuing to see strengths associated with the SMB. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And to your point about the guide I mean, I think our optimism and the relevance of our products and what's happening with digital as a tailwind really leads us to guide as you pointed out to 550, which would be the largest ever guide that we've given for a Q4. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And if you take a step back relative to the approximately 1750 ARR guide that we had given at the beginning of the year, or the 1.8 billion that we've given in March we're going to exceed easily all of those numbers. So, as it relates to individual categories, imaging continues to do really well, video continues to do well, the Acrobat business, which is reflected both in the Creative Cloud, and the Document Cloud is doing well. MAX is going to be exciting. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, net-net, I would say that the growth prospects for that particular business and the growth drivers remain intact. But again, very much in line. And this is what we feel good about the insights that we're getting on the business. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So that's to answer your question on DME. And again, remember, we have a seasonally strong quarter, in Q4 for DME, the enterprise deals tend to be a Q4. We also see education start to ramp up in Q4 so that hopefully gives you some color as to what happened in Q3. And what we expect in Q4. And on the DX side to your second question, really pleased with what we saw in the adoption of the Adobe Experience Platform and the applications on top of that, the Adobe Journey optimizer, the customer journey analytics, continued to see strength. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think we're very unique and differentiated in the platform that we have the real-time nature of what we're doing with personalization. And again there, I think if last year there was a lot of interest in that particular digital transformation and customer experience management. I think people recognize that this needs to be an enterprise spend priority for all of the businesses irrespective of size, which is why both in terms of Q3 performance as well as the Q4 targets, we continue to think that digital experience will also do well. So hopefully that gives you color on both Alex.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It does. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Shantanu.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Kirk Materne</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oh, yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more in a couple of the bigger experienced platform wins that you had. These existing customers, competitive, I guess, if you had to step back, what's helping you all win these larger deals? I was also impressed with 80% of your clients seem to be using some of the ai powered capabilities, which seems to be a really high uptake rate or take rates. So, we're just kind of curious if you expand on some of the larger enterprises - experience platform deals you had this quarter. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure Kirk and at the end of the day, I think the macro trend that everybody is finding is that a digital presence and commerce and data and insights and analytics is absolutely table stakes for anybody doing business. And so, I think everybody started with a website. Everybody started with the analytics. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But I think where we've delivered the Adobe Experience platform and what we're talking about our personalization, I think that's a key differentiator and whether you're a B2B company or a B2C company, you just have to invest in this particular business and I think the team has done a particularly good job both of messaging and different industries, the healthcare industry, for example, continues to do well and there's more interest associated with that. The consumer businesses are starting to see a little bit of a comeback as there's a little bit more normalcy and so a lot of them -- we're going after existing customers. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We're going after new logos and selling more, but I would say it's the strength of the Experience platform, the ability to have these profiles, the behavioral data they were collecting in real-time. The marketing message associated with telling them that they really need to focus on getting their first-party data to be an asset that they could put on their balance sheet. And the nature of what's happening with digital commerce. I think all of those are trends and then we win the deals, because of the strength of our offering and the fact that we're a really pure play marketing that is significantly differentiated relative to anybody else.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Gregg Moskowitz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you very much for taking the question. Shantanu, I know that you only have three-quarters of that data thus far, but is Workfront driving larger, average deal sizes in DX? Is that something that's already showing through?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, it's a great question, Gregg. And then maybe as I had responded to Kirk as well, I should have talked about the big thing that we're hearing from our customers in that space, Gregg, is they have more and more campaigns. They want to do agility of the campaigns. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">These are global and how do they not only have an integrated suite of products, but how do they get the workflow to be more efficient, especially as you're all working in a hybrid, or working from the home environment. So Workfront is definitely helping us, it's helping us with existing customers, it's helping us with deal sizes. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And in many ways, it's the glue both to enable, if you have people, technology, and processes, it's helping with the processes part. But the promise of what we've also said there in terms of this pioneering marketing system of record, that's another area for the interest. And I think this was always a great Company. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think they were looking to become more general purpose. I think what Anil and the team have done, or really focusing on marketing workflows and solving it for all of the different personas. That's definitely resonating, but all of the large deals that we do Workfront’s, definitely a part of the interest and a part of the bill of materials associated with that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Gregg Moskowitz</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Very helpful.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, guys, for taking the question and very nice quarter and maybe digging in a little bit more on the M&amp;A side of the equation, we've definitely heard really good things about Workfront are getting into a lot of deals upfront Perhaps, can you characterize the sort of the performance of Workfront versus your expectations and kind of contribution you're seeing in the quarter. Secondarily with Frame.io, Just for clarification, is that in the forward ARR guys, so is that included in the 550 for Q4? And then perhaps more broadly, just on M&amp;A strategy. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The last two big deals seem to have a common thread in terms of collaboration. Is that just a self-idealist putting together two data points and drawing the trend line, or is that sort of a particular area of focus for Adobe in terms of adding to the portfolio on a go-forward basis? Thank you, guys.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, Keith, I actually think there were three questions in that, so let me parse each one of the first, I think as it relates to Workfront, we're very clearly targeting a need that exists and we had originally, I think said something like Workfront will do a 140. You're a 150 million in revenue for FY 21. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then I think we've said that it's on track to significantly beat that and that continues to be the case. As we do these larger deals, Keith, we don't breakout Workfront. And so that's the way we think about the business. But Workfront is definitely appealing to that. Your second question as it relates to two Frame.io. Uh, no, it is not in the ARR (ph.) guide. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean clearly until we close the deal, we would not. And so, when that happens, as we said, we expect that to happen in Q4. We'll certainly update you on what happens as it relates to the frame. But we're excited about that and your third question as it relates to collaboration as a team, it's part of what we've been talking about for a while. If you remember what we've done with XD in terms of being able to do live editing. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think what we've done with the multi-surface applications, where our applications run on mobile devices, or iPads, or tablets, as well as desktops, is just one of those teams that people are working from different locations. People are increasingly working with people, and so I think we have the ability to really provide value for our existing customers and attract new customers. I think with a frame, in particular, we're excited because it expands dramatically. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The potential of the number of people who will become participants in the video workflow. And if they become, I hope you like the videos that we placed at the beginning of the earnings call and it's -- all of that stuff is being done remotely. We're pleased. And as you know, we are always portfolio Keith about the acquisitions and making sure it's a case where we can bring significant value both to our shareholders and to our customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That spend especially the color guys.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our next question from Michael Turin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Michael Turrin</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hey, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. On margins -- in the year-to-date, margins are now above 46%. I think you previously referenced the potential for more of a second-half step-down there, so just - how should we think about the margin profile here in our other benefits, you'd point to that could be normalized assuming more of a return to normal.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">John, do you want to start and then I can add?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">John Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. You're right. The margins at 46% this quarter we had indicated that with the more of a reopening across different regions, we would start to see our facilities come online, or business. travel, and come back and certainly continue our hiring ramps with the Delta Variant probably slowed that down a little bit. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so that contributed to the margin expansion you saw in Q3. But the overall was an outstanding quarter for older businesses. and what it says, the long road, the path to margin expansion is really to revenue growth given the leverage in our mode and after the contributions from the revenue performance with quarter continued expense and things, I just talked about that contributed overall to the performance. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we expect those expenses to come back in a Phase reentering out maybe a little slower than we originally thought when we talked about the second half, but that being said, when I think about our original targets in December, its implied margin expansion. When we did our updated targets in Q1, it was an even larger margin expansion from what we saw. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we're executing against these huge March opportunities, and we'll continue to do that with an eye and I continued top-line growth, such as areas of [Indiscernible] you touched on, which is 3D and immersive Adobe Experience Platform, sign stock mobile, all of that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well said, John, and maybe the only other thing I would add is that in I - certainly, I think when you look at some of the TENEO facilities expenses, it's a little lock efficient in terms of what's happening on expenses. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But our big position is when you have a 100 and plus billion-dollar addressable market, I think driving profitable growth is where we're focused on, which is why I think John also referred to we continue to be in the market to hire talent, to make sure that we can continue to address all the market opportunities that we have. And so, where folks, just don't drive profitable growth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities, please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jay Vleeschhouwer</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu and John. Shantanu, for you, first as I'm sure you recall over the last number of years, particularly at a conference like MAX, we've talked about the integration, and many ways, the unique integration that you have between Digital Media and the DX business. and you'll recall it's gone by a certain acronym over time.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The question is, can you quantify or in some way. Describe the business effect of that combination and even going back to the old days of how this neutrality does in fact, help you drive business through the integration across the two segments. Relatedly, with regard to. DX specifically, you'll recall that over the last number of years, the Company has often referred to you're having about four dozen or so use cases that you were targeting for DX, and that was a number of years ago. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So perhaps you could talk about how the number of targeted use cases has increased for DX in the last number of years, particularly now with the introduction of payment services and other new capabilities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure, Jay, first I think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about Acrobat, right? Because so much of the Acrobat business is reflected both in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud and so that's one very tangible example of how. We've integrated the clouds. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think taking a step back, the area that I would say is of most interest to customers right now is what we have referred to in the past also as content velocity, which is people are creating more digital assets. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">They're spending more on content and how they both ensured that all of that content seamlessly is distributed, whether it's a marketing campaign, whether it's something that goes on a mobile application, whether it's something that goes on the website. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, I think that's the hard problem that we've been able to help facilitate for our customers, which is creating all of this content and making sure that it's -- the delivery is accelerated through marketing campaigns is an area of real integration between DME, as well as Dx. And where that shows up also in the revenue is the continued growth of M and M assets, specifically because that's where the assets are really flowing between these two solutions. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So hopefully that gives you a little bit of the flavor. I think to the earlier questions that Gregg and Kurt had asked. I mean, it is also on the workflow, that's when people are looking at it and saying, wow, if my freelancers have created content, how's that now being reflected in the DX. So that's what I would answer your first question. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think as it relates to the DX use cases, and we should certainly do an update, it's increased very dramatically. And the ones that I would say maybe as a highlight is the B2B use cases, the number of large B2B companies that are coming to us and saying, ''Hey, we recognize that whether it's for lead generation, whether it's for identification of customers, whether it's for even doing commerce, that's been a fairly big driver.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">'' I would say regulated industries, which if the original push around customer experience management was B2C, and consumer-base companies. Now I think you're seeing way more of those workflows and use cases and in regulated industries, so that's another one that I would do. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I would say the global aspect of this, which is you have companies. Whether you're an automotive Company, or you're a fast-food Company and you want to do this Globally, I think that's a use-case that we've seen a fairly dramatic increase, but so hopefully that gives you one. And then this is where the partner ecosystem candidly also is driving so much more. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, the partner ecosystem is also building a lot of their value-added solutions on top of our horizontal platform. So-net I would say doesn't matter what business you are, what size you are. Part of DX is relevant to what you need to do in order to engage with your customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Jay Vleeschhouwer</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you very much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays. please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Saket Kalia</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here. John may be for you just to -- maybe just to switch gears a bit. I was wondering if you could just talk about seasonality in the Document Cloud business specifically? I think the net new ARR there has historically sort of been up into the right through the year. I guess the question is, are we getting to point in that business where the seasonality could start to look a little bit more like Creative, or are there any things to maybe consider for Document Cloud ARR seasonality this quarter?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">John Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">When we look -- think about the situation we've been in the pandemic and the need for more paper to digital transformation that's impacting, not just enterprises and institutions that have obviously you've seen great growth in, but individuals as well as they're engaging with the services that they use. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As we said, I think when you look at the individual offerings that we have across Creative and Document Cloud, we just saw a little bit lower-traffic there, but that's associated where we believe with individuals enjoying our holidays and its pretty indicative using our own Adobe Digital Index data. That's. So, the gyms a lot over the highest travel months in two years. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So that seasonality is hitting it a little bit, but again, we've got such a strong presence in both institutions, education, all the governments, and enterprises on Document Cloud that we still see great growth and strengthening. It's demonstrated and just the continued growth to that business, which is our fastest-growing business right now.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Saket Kalia</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Very helpful.

Thank you for taking my question. This one is for you Shantanu. You guys have a history of bringing your professional tool down to the consumer, you had light edition, you have mobile editions. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the addition of Frame.io, creating additional opportunities the sort of across the customer base, teams, and enterprises, I guess do you envision this as a platform that could be brought down to Consumer prosumers? Or is it still a man (ph.) they going to be in that professional bucket?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Ken? It's a very important area of expansion for us. I mean, I think the Creative has always been a segment that looks to us to deliver mission-critical products that enable them to make a livelihood. But the halo effect of that, when you look at what we talked about at our analyst meetings and you know, how big is communicated business already is as well as the outreach of that even into the consumer business. But stay tuned on that front. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think as we talk about our product roadmap and the excitement that we have to fulfill this vision of creativity for all and target a broader and broader and broader set of customers with some great solutions using our artificial intelligence and Sensei technology, we have some very exciting things underway. That will start to be served to customers. So, we're very excited about that opportunity, it's a big opportunity. It's already a big business for us. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, when we talk about the fact that we're adding over 0.5 billion of net new ARR as our expectation for Q4. A portion of that is also going to what you would call communicators or prosumers. And we're going to be delivering more and more really phenomenal products, targeted at that customer segment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Ken Wong</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Got it.

Congratulations Shantanu and team, a fantastic quarter. Shantanu, I remember, I think what's the MAX 2019 we talked about video and how that could be as big of an opportunity as photos and I'm curious to get your thoughts on the total available market that is new and incremental to Adobe's Creative business as a result of the acquisition that you made afraid Particularly you used the word dramatically expansive scope of what you could do, meaning collaborators in addition to content creators, can you just talk about what you mean by that, you can just put a final point. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">This is means that the greatest term will be then, what Wall Street thinks we just always been the case for the past ten years or so. And secondly, not that it's a negative, but what would the seasonal pattern and in summer joined some side of activity where people don't vacation, et cetera. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Is there at all any risk that digital transformation takes a bit of a backseat as we go shopping, not online, they will go to stores, therefore, e-commerce activity might actually start out on it, but the secular trend is too pretty solid. But jumps on the adjustment have reinforced some adjustment or maybe not, but I just want to get your thoughts on that, Thank you so much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Kash, I mean, as it relates to your first question around video, I think we've been signaling for a while that video is really one of the exciting expansion opportunities for us and that's really played out. It's played out from the products that we've delivered. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Premier and after effects continuing to be the leaders in that category, sadly Photoshop and illustrator used a lot. But if you look at what's happening with all these streaming plus services, right? I mean, there isn't a Company that isn't delivering streaming plus service. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, I think the insatiable demand for video among consumers is only requiring more and more companies to have these streaming services and deliver more genre as it relates to video. All of that works right now, I mean, we talked a little bit about what we're doing as a partnership with Netflix as well. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">All of that is happening now with people in different locations through a collaborative process. So anytime you can take a creative. idea and make that happen quicker, faster to the right audience. That's only going to be incredibly valuable to our customers. And so, I think that trend is only going to continue. And so, we feel really good about what's happening in that particular space with the video frame, we used to use frame-up. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">A bunch in the production of our own videos and it's been exciting as we've talked to different people who after the acquisition of frame have come and said; Hey, Adobe, that's such a great product, but we think we can do more with it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, I think that gives us a lot of optimism around whether it's the scriptwriter, whether it's, the reviewer of that, whether it's a creative agency, just being able to or all the corporate videos that's being done. And so certainly, I think as you add that as enterprise product as well, you can certainly get a lot more TAM associated with it. We will update our TAM's cash as we typically do. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think Jonathan referred or will talk about how we do our Q4 as well as our 2022. And we'll talk to you about terms on that front, but really excited about that. I think the external partnerships that exist for the frame and how it's plugged in, not just to the Adobe solutions, but other solutions are also an area of strength. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I think to your second question around shopping and online when we look at our DX business and the success that we had in Q3. I mean, a big part of that is more and more companies are thirdly doing the multi-channel omnichannel, whatever they want to call it. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I think that's only going to continue to be a driver of our Digital Experience Solutions. Because today that stable stakes and so we just look at it and say whether you're shopping in-store over they are shopping online. You need a solution that treats you like a customer that we know of. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, I think that's going to only be an imperative for companies. I mean, one thing we should have probably talked about also is if you look at our Q3 results. I mean, there were stronger than what we had said. There were a couple of non-recurring items as part of that and some of that actually had to do with usage in commerce. And so, we are seeing that usage also ramp up. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, I just wanted to get that. Also, are there as we talked about shopping online and shopping in a store. And in terms of the demand for our DME solutions, we expect as -- as we said, the seasonal Q4 will be the strength and as education comes back and there's more and more end of the quarter activity, not just within the Adobe, but all companies. That's going to lead to increased demand and acceleration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's fantastic.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks for taking my question, John, I wanted to come back to the Document Cloud business. Because it looks, perhaps, to me, that there was some outside strength from licensed products that may have been in lieu of revenue coming from ARR products. and I think you can see this with total Document Cloud revenue growth actually accelerating even though total ARR growth decelerated. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So is that the right assessment and we'd be looking at total revenue, not ARR and I guess. So, is there any reason for a mix shift towards more licensed products and as you look into Q4, given it's a big ELA, quarter, should we expect that to continue?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">John Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes. No. I mean, we -- well, certainly, yeah. You're going to see strength in ELA as [Indiscernible] and I spoke of in terms of Q4, just to see the expansion in Q3 as well. But we still migrate basic customers as well. So ARR is still going to be important for us and where you want to drive more ARR. I think those strengthen our growth, frankly, over the last -- over a year really has been really impressive. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It's always going to give us this opportunity, to drive healthy subscription growth. But LA is not going to give us outsized revenue in Q4, it's going to be a sizable contribution, but we're driving subscriptions and that's, that's a strategy. And we do still have customers that buy perpetual, and so it will be some fluctuations in that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes.

Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our next question from Parker Lane with Stifel. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Parker Lane</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, thanks for taking my question, Sean, I was wondering if you could talk about the nature of Creative wins in the public sector with organizations like the Department of Interior, what do these types of organizations historically relied upon for Creative needs and hopefully, they're embracing the features of the Creative Cloud versus using maybe a particular application like Photoshop or a distinct set of applications. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To your point, I think the public sector has always been an important part, but I think it's just the amount of content that people are creating is increasing. And when the amount of content that people are creating, then content management becomes an important issue. Workflow becomes an important issue. And the standardization of the products. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And one of the things we did really well is what we called our named user deployment and how, you know, when we have these enterprise licensing agreements, we offer enterprises the ability to download and distribute within the companies. And the more we do training and evangelism of the products, that leads to adoption. So, I would say there's an element of standardization, there's an element of more content. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, even if you're a public sector Company right now, I mean, what you transact online is becoming dramatically greater than it's ever been because the physical presence is seeing cutback as a result of what's happened in the pandemic. I think all of those are macro trends that are going to continue, but we've also done a really good job of actively making sure we evangelize what these solutions are. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good fall, we do more training within these enterprises. We allow these named user deployments, as I said, with ten leads to true. Well, ups and the ability to get them into a higher band. So, I think the execution on the sales front associated with going into these enterprises, that's getting better and better.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Parker Lane</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great feedback. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Jonathan Vaas</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Operator. We're coming up on the top of the hour. We have time for two more questions. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. We'll take our second last question from Brad Sills, Bank of America Securities.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brad Sills</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question here. Just with your view across the broader marketing stack here with Experience Cloud. I'm curious what you're observing with regard to these Customer 360 initiatives. Are you finding customers are taking more of multiproduct deals here to get that view across multiple channels here, e-commerce, marketing automation, CMS? You've got workflow automation in there. Are there any combinations of any of that that you're seeing trending more recently, been in the past? Thank you so much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It clearly has been a push for us, Brad, in terms of, you know, what we're doing, which is how do we sell the entire suite offering? And I think every year we give you an update on how. That is actually indeed, how we are selling it. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, from our perspective, the marketing stack, what's completely unique about us, is the data and insights that we're getting, the ability to do commerce, and the digital presence. I think as it relates to customers, we have 60 waivers unique and I think we're years ahead of it. Any other large Company that has space is this real-time nature of what we've delivered, it's scalable, we've got billions of profiles. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so, I think a lot of other companies are talking about how they take something that may be in the record somewhere and do things with it. But for us, it's the activation of that data. And that's where I think most people are really excited about what Adobe has to offer. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And the other thing that I think is really happened, is people recognize that they have to get control of their first-party data. I think a lot of interest used to exist about customer acquisition and third-party data. But I think right. Now it's about dupi have even control of our first-party data. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Do we have control of our behavior? And what is happening on multiple channels? And the fact that that can be very easily answered as it relates to what we have done with the Adobe Experience Platform. Last but not least. I mean, remember we're the only Company that can go in. And say, hey, we have a B2B business and a B2C business. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And when we talk about how we're using this in terms of the playbook on Adobe.com, I think that really opens up a lot of people's ideas as to how they can use this and utilize it. And so, I think the playbook that we delivered for D dom earlier this year and how we talk about what they can do. I think that's what -- that really resonates with customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brad Sills</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's great to hear. Thanks, Jonathan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We'll take our final question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Shantanu, the DX DRaaS accelerating from Q2. Can you just walk through the drivers of what you're seeing in terms of that acceleration? And maybe for John, just as it relates to seasonality with Magento and commerce in the Q4, anything to keep in mind there as you just feel like this -- to keep powering through the tougher comps given -- given the [Indiscernible] you're seeing in that business. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Shantanu Narayen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Brian, I think what really drove that revenue was both subscriptions as well as the services. As you know, the services, were again, really reliant on a large partner ecosystem. But if over the last 18 months. As we've always talked about, the interest is high. How they are all implementing it. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And so as they continue to implement it, and as they continue to say, we need to invest in these solutions, I think that's driving it, and I think to your point, if you take a step back, we -- I think guided to something like 19% revenue at the beginning of the year, and 22% in subscriptions, we had increased that in March, 22023 respectively, and we just posted 2629 and so and if you look at it for Q4 as well as you point out with the large comps, we continue to be excited about that opportunity. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So, I think there is. This is a front-end center, it's an enterprise priority. And I think since people are staying, we've got to deal with this new reality, there's no time to waste in terms of implementing it. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Again, there were, as we said, a couple of non-recurring items. some of those had to do with usage in commerce and that actually is also indicative that maybe a little bit more depends on the quarter, but it's up to the right as far as we're concerned in terms of the business opportunity in the business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Murphy</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Go ahead.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Shantanu Narayen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">No, go ahead. Sorry, Jonathan, I didn't hear you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>John Murphy</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yeah, no problem. Just going to just kind of over the top on Brent's question on seasonality-related commerce, of course, in Q4 as a strong commerce quarter anyway. Given the holidays, spending trend. And so, we're excited about the opportunity there as well, it's just trying to set us up into the right, I think we have great momentum.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Shantanu Narayen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And overall, since that was the last question, I mean, again, I think we were really pleased with our performance in Q3. We do expect a strong end of the year for our business. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As you saw from our targets, it's clear that your win, this unique position that we have three large growth opportunities ahead of us and we're executing well against all three of those and the innovation and the roadmap that exists across all three of those clouds just gives us continued optimism that we will serve our customers well and we feel fortunate. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think the future of work and the fact that it's more hybrid will only continue to emphasize digital as a priority for companies of every size. And so, whether that's an increase in content for personalization, whether that's more automation of digital documents, and whether that's every business thing we need to understand how to do customer experience management. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I believe Adobe is very unique. We position to drive those particular macroeconomic trends. But thank you for joining us today, we look forward to the max, as well as the Q4 earnings call. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Jonathan Vaas</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Jonathan here.
