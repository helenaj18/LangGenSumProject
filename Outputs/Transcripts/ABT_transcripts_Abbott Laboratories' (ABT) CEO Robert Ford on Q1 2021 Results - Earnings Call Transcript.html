Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At the start of the year, we issued full-year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we’re right on track with those expectations. Our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors: including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all four of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently-launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we’re making across our portfolio in R&amp;D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’ll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob, and I’ll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW, and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. emergency use authorization for over-the-counter nonprescription self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday. Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our core lab and molecular diagnostic businesses, both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter. It was particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China, and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And lastly, I’ll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated coast case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On average, in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business, with some areas even higher. In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall, with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico, and others.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S. where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I’ll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So in summary, we’re off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All four of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We’re particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently-launched products, and we’re well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’ll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Robert Funck</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis which is consistent with our previous guidance.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full-year 2021 sales.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&amp;D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 25.1% of sales. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million, non-operating income was $73 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full-year effective tax rate from last year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, we’ll now open the call for questions.</p> <p id="question-answer-session" class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oh, thanks, and good morning. Congratulations on such a strong Q1 revenue and profit growth. I don’t think I can recall the last time a company put up 100% earnings growth, so impressive there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I guess I’d love to hear your thoughts on two important topics, Robert, if you don’t mind. And the first topic is BinaxNOW OTC. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. So that’s the first topic.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then I’ll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time. The second topic is a little bit longer-term oriented, because last quarter, you expressed some confidence in Abbott’s ability to drive double-digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year. And the question I would have is, based on what you’re seeing today, has anything changed with your views? And I think investors would also love to hear if you assume a more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double-digit earnings growth next year?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So just wanted to list it all up front there, and thanks for taking the questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Okay. Thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we’re very excited about that. We see this as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that’s been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S. which is this move, accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment where consumers and people can get their results at a much faster rate and quite frankly, with a little bit of less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">It’s easy. It’s affordable. And I think that’s a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those two areas, right? It needs to be affordable. It’s difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you’ve got a cost of $100-plus and takes between two to three days to get that. So I think we’re in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. We’ve been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Specifically in the U.S., we’ve got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment and the retail channel. And those are capabilities that as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there. So we’re excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we’re probably the leaders here in terms of production. We’ve got an established capacity this quarter now that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms, so we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To your second question on 2022, yes, we did – you did mention our confidence back in January and we commented on our call, and to be honest, nothing’s changed on that front. Nothing’s changed over the last 90 days. We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth and we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digits in 2022, whether it’s the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera, and none of that has changed. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that’s done very well. Cardio and Neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double-digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and a Molecular Diagnostics, excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We’ve got momentum with a lot of our product launches. MitraClip G4, TriClip, I’d say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices. And then we’ve got coming out of this year going into next year four key product launches that we feel very good about, we’re very excited about, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA, entering the LAA market here in the U.S., a potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, all four of those opportunities are multibillion dollar segments. And we’ve been working hard over the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction, and I don’t see any changes. If anything, there’s acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There’s, as I said, there’s a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We’re the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we will be – we’ll be the share leader here for sure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double-digit. The one thing I’ll say is that as you look at all of these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double-digit in 2020, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So if you look at our history, we’re pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there’s any caution here I guess for next year, it would already be – seem to be priced here into our PE. So with that being said, I don’t think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel really good about our double-digit.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That’s great. Thank you. And then just if there was a more conservative testing environment, how does that impact the way you think about things?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I mean, I guess that’s the model here where we start to model different ways, different parts of all these elements that I explained to you, and it’s going to be difficult. I’m not going to put out an assumption there of what COVID testing level is required. But I do feel that a good portion of it is going to be sustainable, and we’ll get a lot of the share of the COVID testing that remains, so.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. Thanks for taking the questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Oh, great. And I’ll echo Bob’s congratulations on a very nice quarter. Maybe just to follow up, Robert, I’d love to get a sense – one of the key investor topics as you just touched on is the double-digit target for EPS growth next year, and part of that, it looks like you’re front loading a lot of expenses into 2021 here. You grew OpEx about $300 million versus last year. So I’d love to see if I could just get a little more meat on the bones in terms of the roadmap to that double-digit EPS, more down the P&amp;L versus the top line which you just talked about, and does it imply sort of high-20s operating margins to get there? Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the high 20s operating margin, yes, that does to be the case. Regarding the areas of investment, I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we’re making. I’d say from a bigger-picture perspective, we want to make sure that we’re spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&amp;D portion of the P&amp;L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment, and if I look across all of the businesses in Devices, in Diagnostics, in Rapid Diagnostics, in Nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&amp;D, and we’ve got clear programs across all of them to build the R&amp;D programs that will sustain our growth beyond 2022, 2023, 2024.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it’s the ones that we’ve just launched over the last kind of quarter, two or three quarters, plus the four key areas that we’re looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth, and those have already been funded. But I would say the investments here really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio in Devices, that will lead to new product launches in 2023 and 2024.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the SG&amp;A side, we’re making sure that we’re supporting our big growth products. I’d say probably a lot of the SG&amp;A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth both in the U.S. and international markets, and you’ll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year both in terms of the spend and the return on the top line.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We’re making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brands and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the Adult Nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our Device businesses where we know that clinical specialist and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products but the launch of new products.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Great. Really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We’re all really interested to hear not just about how the Devices business did in first quarter, but really the forward commentary and what you’re seeing exiting March and into April here. So if you have any early feedback on the exit rates and what you’re expecting in terms of catch-up, that would be really helpful. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I mean, I think as I said in my prepared comments and on the first question too, I mean, we saw nice recovery. Obviously – there was obviously some – a little bit of a slowdown in January, so we had a nice pick-up I’d say in October, November, where – sorry, yes, October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth, and I’d say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased. But saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And Robert, what we try to do also is we try to look at, you know, March is a tricky month because you’ve got those two weeks of last year where things kind of really shut down, so we look at March not only versus last year but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019, and we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw real nice growth. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that’s a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals. Saw double-digit there. Our Molecular diagnostic business excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing was up 30%. So that’s a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launches to market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there too.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I’d say very good exit rate, and as we look at the first two weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. So I didn’t see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP, and even in CRM. So those are – that’s a nice trend as we’re going into the second quarter too.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And we’ll start to see a little bit of opening up in Europe. I’d say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I’d say the first couple weeks in Europe are looking pretty good.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That’s great to hear. Appreciate the color. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, one from me on capital allocation, and one on your favorite topic, I think, Libre.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So a lot of questions around 2022, and my question is how important is it to hit that double-digit EPS growth target in 2022, and your thoughts around capital allocation helping you achieve the $5.50 in EPS, is a buyback or an accretive deal something you would consider to get there? And I had one follow-up on Libre.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. Well, we start every year as I said targeting double-digit. If you look at where we are in 2021 versus 2019, we’re up 53%, but we’ll be targeting, as I said, double-digit in 2022, and again, there’s multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try and have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between short- and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. So whether it’s in the form of dividend, we’re committed to a strong growing dividend. It’s an important part of our identity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On the share repurchasing, we’ve historically relooked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going – in this year going into next year. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then from an M&amp;A perspective, I’d say we’re always actively monitoring. We’re always actively looking, and you’ll always hear me say that I’m not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there’s something that is attractive, something that has got growth that won’t dilute our top line growth profile which I think is best-in-class or that we can do better with, we’re always going to be interested. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we’re always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long-term, the short-term, the internal and the external, and this is not kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been an Abbott philosophy. We’re good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That’s very helpful. And on Libre, how should we think about the growth for the remainder of the year? The comps get a little easier. You talked about 40% as an aspirational goal on the last call. And just what’s the latest on the Libre 3 launch in Europe, and if you’ll give us any color on the U.S., it would be certainly appreciated. But I’m not sure we’ll get it today. But thank you for taking the questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. Well, I did put out a goal of growing 40% in 2021. You mentioned comparison. Yes, there was a little bit of a – you’ve got a little bit of a balance here between Q1 and Q2. So Q1 last year we saw some stocking up in international and in the U.S., so I look at our 30% here and on top of a pretty strong quarter last year as really positive momentum.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We’ll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2, so then it becomes really a second half can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half, and the answer is we believe so. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We’ve got a great portfolio. We’ve got great momentum. And making the investments whether it’s field force, whether it’s direct consumer advertising, not just in the U.S. but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. I mean, we’ve achieved 3 million – surpassed 3 million users around the world. That’s – we could say that’s three times our next competitor, but the reality is, the penetration for us and for the category is still pretty significant. So there’s plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we’ll be doing that on the back of our – not only our commercial investments but also our R&amp;D.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Your question on Libre 3, we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We’re right where we want to be. We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn, we learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We’ve got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. But there’s always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform and we learn with insurance and insurance switches over and all those things, and once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go brick. But we’ve got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we’re in a great position.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Feedback has been really good. I mean, we’ve launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We’ve got close to a couple hundred patients that we’ve now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it’s been extremely positive. There’s a lot of social media there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’m not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that, it’s all great. It’s all good. So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that’s good. Robert, I’m not going to provide any details here, but I’m just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hey, guys. Congrats on the print and thanks for taking my question. Robert, I did want to ask you on fiscal 2021, if I look at Q1 excluding contribution from COVID, the base business looks like it was up 10% organic versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. One, is that math correct? And if you’re starting off at 10%, I guess are we looking at perhaps teens kind of growth for fiscal 2021 on the top line on the base business?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi, Vijay. This is Bob. Yes, your math is spot on. Our first quarter was up over 2019 by around 10%, so we had really good performance in the quarter in the base business, and you really saw that across kind of the portfolio of businesses and then we would expect to continue to see strong growth during the course of the rest of the year, in particular as Medical Device procedures continue to improve and we would expect to see kind of that base business growth in the mid-teens.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That’s helpful. And then one on the antigen testing side. I saw the press release yesterday, launching the asymptomatic consumer version of the product. I guess how were revenues recognized? Is this recognized on shipment? And what are early – what is early demand looking like from the retailers, the CVS and Walgreens, Walmart? And is there an expectation of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal 2019? Is that unchanged? Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, so on the $6.5 billion to $7 billion, that remains unchanged. It’s difficult to forecast here in that tight range that you would expect from Abbott, but yes, we continue to forecast sales at around that level.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Regarding your question, I think it was regarding the BinaxNOW OTC in the U.S., correct? Is that what you were referring to?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Correct.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, so yes, we received approval for the product several weeks ago and we immediately started our manufacturing process. It is a different presentation from the previous Binax test in which we provide two tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. So we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers and we’ll start with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, et cetera, to roll into that as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. So, yes, we shipped the product and the revenue is booked when the asset is transferred over to the retailer.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But I think this is going to be, as I said, a great opportunity. It’s a channel we know very well. I think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to kind of really compete. So we feel very good about our position, and we’ll start. We start off with initial stocking orders and then from then we’ll roll out more distribution and we expect, given the price point here, Vijay, that there’s going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the U.S. to be able to have testing on-hand, ready to go, at their house. So we expect that there will be a nice repeat purchase also.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’m planning on stocking up, Robert. Thanks for the comments.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I thank you for that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Matt Miksic</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi. Just a quick question from me, if I could. Just on some of the pipeline opportunities around Amulet and CardioMEMS and Portico, if you could provide us with maybe an update on those programs. And secondly, on just the progression of MitraClip, this has been a device and procedure that was a little bit more impacted by the slowdown over the winter, and just love to get a sense of what the trajectory looks like now heading into Q2. Thanks.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So couple there. So on the Amulet side, listen, we’ve got experience in this category outside of the United States in the international markets and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It’s approaching about $1 billion today and it’s growing double-digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. We’re obviously – we’ll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&amp;D investments I mentioned in next generations there also, but even in its current format, it performs very well and we’ve got a great experience in Europe.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe a lot in this market, in this segment, and so we’ve also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year and this is a trial comparing Amulet to no act drugs which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that are at risk of a stroke. So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to the segment because we believe we’ve got a great product, great product portfolio, pipeline, and it’s a great segment here. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory and kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds in hospitals moved towards treating COVID. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But we had great growth in Q1. We’re up in the mid-teens in the U.S., so that was good. As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March, and that wasn’t just catch-up because I looked at the procedures in the first two weeks of April, and they continue to move up. So that’s very positive for us. And we’re making our investments not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers, so that’s done very well and I think the NCD that got approved in January opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Remember, we’re only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here, and I think that we’ve got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity, and we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20% and that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to the idea of the double-digit growth and the investments that you’re making this year, you called out R&amp;D and we’ve seen DTC has been stepping up, I think there’s a lot of Libre commercials there now. I guess my question is when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically we’ve thought about Abbott as driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. So I’d say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-COVID, and I’d say with these investments that we’re making excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we would probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range. I mean, once you factor in maybe a Q1 comparison on the base business, next year you’re probably growing higher than that, Matt.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Bu at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we’re looking at with all these investments and product development and portfolio development.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders but part of it goes back into the business, and we’ve got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean, I’d probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we’ve all agreed to are kind of next steps, if we have more opportunity to invest in the business we know exactly where to go.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn’t be toggling down R&amp;D. I think that’s more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It’s easier to toggle on SG&amp;A and we’ve got that capability also if we need to.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I just had a follow-up on Diagnostics. The underlying growth as you called out in Core Lab and Molecular was impressive, and I’m wondering if we’re going to see you get increased momentum in the underlying business because of your success with COVID Diagnostics? Do you think you can leverage that larger installed base and drive to higher growth in the Core Diagnostic business over time now?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, I think the answer to that is yes. We’ve definitely been elevated to kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institution as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There’s been a large set of accounts that we’ve historically been out of and now have had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. So the answer to that is yes, on the core lab, for sure.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">You are seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business where we haven’t seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business excluding COVID in a very long time and we were up close to 30% excluding COVID testing, a lot of that has to do with the instruments that we’re placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays, on the other tests. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So on the rapid side too, I wouldn’t just look at it from a core lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we’re placing as a result of that.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I talked a little bit about this, building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID’s allowing us to do that. If you think about example our ID NOW instrument where we basically seeded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in a world outside of COVID by placing these instruments. We had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we’re currently at 75,000 boxes, so we almost quadrupled our installed base there. And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic one, two years out? No, probably not, but they’ll be very productive with all of our other assays and that installed base will continue to grow, will continue to produce for us.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">To answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the core lab, on the Molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you very much for taking the questions. I’ll just put them both upfront. Can you give us an idea of how you’re thinking about revenue for the remainder of the year, particularly I’m going to get questions about COVID-19 diagnostic revenue in 2021? And then my second question has to do with the other areas of med tech that are starting to support or continue to support that high single digit growth rate. Anything you can add color on Neuromod, CRM would be helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Sure. So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is at least how we modeled is we’ll see our – let’s call it non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you’ll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3, that will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. But I think we always look at it, at least the way we’re managing it here, is we’re always looking at it on a two-year CAGR. If we can get up to that 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our core lab business on a two-year CAGR, that’s basically our target to be able to get to those numbers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">COVID testing it’s difficult to forecast right now. I can’t give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we’ve given last call, I continue to reiterate it. It’s going to be a little difficult to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">What I will say though is I continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as relates to surveillance, and as I said I think we’re well positioned there. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I’d say, listen, I’m very pleased with CRM. I’m not saying that we’ve completely turned it around, but it’s a great progression that we’re seeing here. The launch of our ICD and CRTDs with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and the U.S.. All of the numbers show we’re picking up share and that’s the ultimate measure here. And I’m excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities and the value proposition that that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that’s done very well.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I’d say Heart Failure, one of the challenges there is probably – that’s probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays, so I think that was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I’d say our share is pretty high, around the mid-80s, 85%. So that’s mostly a market condition that we’ll see come back, but I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I don’t know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">If you could hit on Neuromod that would be great. And thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, so we did see a little bit of a slowdown in trials towards the end of the year, the beginning of the year and we saw that start to pick up a little bit now. We think that we like our position. We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that’s going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S.. I think it applies to both SCS and DBS too. We’ve gotten great feedback on that so I think that we’ll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro, not only as we lap the comps but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then we’ve got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you very much.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Operator, we’ll take one more question.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Josh Jennings</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to, Rob, just ask about your commentary about the potential to pursue M&amp;A to support if need be to support the double-digit earnings growth in 2022, and anything you can provide investors or analysts with in terms of the areas of focus. Should we be thinking that each business unit could receive some support with the acquisition? </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then specifically on Medical Devices, just a follow-up to Joanne’s question, what should we be thinking about potential, the bolstering Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromod, some of the softer businesses here. You had such a pipeline and had such success with internal development initiatives, is Medical Device scenario where you could add. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">And then lastly, just on the Structural Heart business, in the U.S., you’re going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term. And just how are you thinking about – you mentioned the specialized sales force. What should we be thinking about individual sales teams for MitraClip, TAVR and occlusion and how could that all shape out? Thank you for taking the questions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Yes, so I think on the M&amp;A side, you’ll hear me say the same thing which is I think it always starts off strategically, does the business that we’re looking at have a strategic fit to Abbott both from a market position, from a financial standpoint? So we wouldn’t be looking at anything that doesn’t fit us strategically just to fill an EPS. We want businesses that we can grow, that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company, so I think it always starts like that it always starts with the strategic fit and then if it’s attractive, if the timing is right, then we’ll look at it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think all the areas you that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. But we look at all those areas you that you mentioned. We look at Diagnostics. We look at all the areas. We’re always studying, we’re always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I just wouldn’t tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focus and dedicated teams has always been best. That’s kind of how we’ve run our businesses. It’s how we’ve run our businesses for many, many decades. We don’t try and bring things together that don’t make sense just for the sake of synergies.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">If we believe we’re in growth areas and growth businesses, then we’ll fund them as growth business and growth areas and quite frankly all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">So I’ll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5.00 which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That’s after 13% growth in 2020 and we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those, at least those $5.00. We have multiple ways to get there.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera, and we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022 and I’m very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business, Abbott, or call it the non-COVID side of our business, and we’re making investments in 2021 so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond and we talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we’re in today and the position we have this year and going into next year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Scott Leinenweber</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott’s conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 AM Central Time today on Abbott’s Investor Relations website at abbottinvester.com.
