[ph] Wei Shi Dai will be translating for Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang, you may proceed.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Huang Jia Dong</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, David. On behalf of the company, I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and fiscal yearend 2015 earnings conference call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the fourth quarter of 2015, we experienced increasingly challenging market conditions due to an array of macroeconomic factors that have impacted the Chinese economy, and which have negatively impacted the real estate and building materials market. A contraction in consumer demand resulted in a 13.2% decline in the fourth quarter's revenue as compared to the same period in 2014.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We also incurred a substantial assets write-down, which significantly affected the fourth quarter's bottomline, but due to the non-cash nature of this event, our adjusted EBITDA was RMB32.9 million or approximately US$5 million, up 15.4% as compared to the year-ago quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors with new products and are excited about the addition of glazed brick ceramic tiles to our product portfolio, as it is a highly effective solution for high-rise apartment buildings and housing projects. This new production line at our Hengdali facility is capable of producing customized roofing tiles according to consumer's specifications. And following extensive testing in the first quarter of 2016, we expect full production to begin in the second quarter of 2016.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">During the fourth quarter, we utilized production facilities capable of producing 26 million square meters of ceramic tiles per year out of a total annual production capacity of 72 million square meters. Although, we have a substantial amount of capacity available for utilization, in the near-term we do not have plans to bring additional capacity online, as we are currently experiencing a contraction in demand for our product.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the full year 2015, our revenue was down 2%, but our gross profit rose by over 20% due to operating efficiencies. Our adjusted EBITDA, which excluded the fourth quarter's non-cash asset write-down was RMB154.5 million or approximately US$23 million. We also repaid approximately US$7 million in short-term debt during the fourth quarter due to a tightening of credit across China.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead to 2016, we believe that the operating environment will continue to be challenging. However, we are confident that we can weather the current market volatility and leverage our market position to maintain our existing customers as well as win new customers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We expect a consolidation trend among larger property developers, which would benefit the company since our manufacturing scale and infrastructure enable us to effectively serve these large enterprises. In the long-term, we believe that real estate is a key sector of China's economy that will continue to draw investments and that the urbanization and economic trends underlying the growth in China's real estate sectors are sustainable</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">With that, I would like to turn over the call to the company's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Edmund Hen, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter earnings results in more detail. Thank you.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Edmund Hen</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Thank you, Mr. Huang. I will now move on to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Our revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, was RMB208.3 million or US$31.6 million, a decrease of 13.2% from RMB240.1 million or US$38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily due to a 13% decrease in sales volume to 6.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles from the year-ago quarter slightly offset by a 0.3% increase in average selling price to RMB31.1 per square meters from the year-ago quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Gross profit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 was RMB29.5 million or US$4.5 million, an increase of 1.4% from RMB29.1 million or US$4.7 million in the year ago quarter. The gross profit margin was 14.2% for the fourth quarter compared to a gross profit margin of 12.1% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in gross margin was by adjusting production and achieving better control of labor costs.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The loss from operations before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 was RMB406.5 million or US$64.2 million as compared to RMB10.1 million or US$1.6 million in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, profit from operations before taxation for the current quarter was RMB15.1 million or US$2.3 million, which excludes the non-cash fair value loss on impairment of non-current assets for the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares to RMB10.1 million or US$1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, which will reflect the key deduction of expenses due to the provision for settlement of litigation of RMB5.3 million or US$0.9 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was RMB411.3 million or US$4.8 million as compared to a net profit of RMB4.8 million US$0.8 million in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, net profit was RMB10.4 million or US$1.6 million in the current quarter, which excludes the non-cash fair value loss on the impairment of non-current assets for the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares to RMB4.8 million or US$0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, which reflect the deduction of expenses due to the provision for the settlement of litigation of RMB5.3 million or US$0.9 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Loss per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2015 was RMB20.13 or US$3.11 as compared to RMB0.23 or US$0.04 for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the current quarter was RMB0.51 or US$0.08, which excludes the non-cash fair value loss on the impairment of non-current assets for the fourth quarter 2015.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">EBITDA for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, was a negative RMB388.7 million or US$61.5 million. Adjusting for the non-cash impairment of assets in the current quarter, EBITDA was RMB32.9 million or US$5 million, up 15.4% from RMB28.5 million or US$4.6 million in the year-ago quarter.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">For the full year ended December 31, 2015, revenue was RMB1,017.1 million or US$160.4 million, a decrease of 2% as compared to RMB1,037.7 million or US$167.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross profit was RMB125.4 million or US$19.8 million, up 20.1% from RMB104.4 million or US$16.8 million. Gross margin for the full year 2015 was 12.3% compared to 10.1% for the full year 2014.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, net profit for fiscal 2015 was RMB59.2 million or US$9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as adjusted for the non-cash RMB421.6 million or US$66.5 million fair value loss on the impairments of non-current assets for the fourth quarter end December 31, 2015, as compared to net profit of RMB29.2 million or US$4.7 million for fiscal year 2014, as adjusted for the RMB59.5 million or US$9.6 million of realized and unrealized fair value loss on derivative financial instruments incurred during the period.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and bank balances of RMB0.5 million or US$0.08 million as compared to RMB61.2 million or US$9.9 million as of fiscal yearend 2014. The decrease in cash and bank balances was primarily the net repayment of RMB46 million or US$7.1 million in the fourth quarter of the year.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of fiscal yearend 2015, our debt consist of short-term bank borrowings, which were RMB40.1 million or US$6.2 million as compared to RMB84.7 million or US$13.7 million. This decrease is reflecting the net repayment of short-term bank borrowings of RMB46 million or US$7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As of December 31, 2015, inventory turn was 131 days compared to 125 days as of December 31, 2014. Trade receivables turnover was 163 days compared with 156 days as of fiscal yearend 2014. Prior to 2012, the company typically offered a credit period of 90 days of our distributors, but expanded it to 150 days to our distributors since the end of 2012 to adjust funding pressure associated with challenging real estate market conditions in China. We extended the credit period from 90 days to 120 days to direct company accounts at the end of 2014.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As a capital expenditure update, in the third quarter we began renovating our state-of-the-art showroom in our Hengda facility, which we call the Exhibition Hall, which is a valuable resource for the marketing and promotion of our building material products. We are confident that upgrading this showroom will enable us to continue to secure significant new contracts for our products from larger property developers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">CapEx for the new renovations to the Hengda Exhibition Hall were RMB3.9 million or US$0.6 in the third quarter and RMB6.6 million or US$1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no unpaid balances as of December 31, 2015. The total cost of the renovations, which were completed in the fourth quarter, was RMB10.5 million or US$1.6 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As previously announced, we constructed a new production line to manufacture glazed brick ceramic tiles in our Hengdali facility, which we believe will be an attractive addition to our current product portfolio. This new product is engineered to be competitively-priced and a highly effective roofing solution for both high rise apartment and housing projects that complements our existing ceramic tiles products.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Capital expenditures for the new line were RMB18.6 million or US$2.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 and RMB130.1 million or US$20.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no unpaid balances as of December 31, 2015. The total cost of new production was RMB148.7 million or US$23 million.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Moving on to our business outlook. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company experienced a substantial decline in business activity as compared to fourth quarter of 2014. The company's sales volume of 6.7 million square meters represents a 13% reduction in sales volume from the 7.7 million square meters recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. This was the lowest level of sales volume attained since the first quarter of 2013, when a difficult business environment caused a decline in sales volume and pricing pressure on the company's products impelled us to institute price cuts in order to maintain market share.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The company attributes the currently challenging conditions to lower economic growth in China, which has affected the real estate and construction sectors, and which has resulted in a contraction in investment and new housing projects by property developers, although the fourth quarter's average selling price rose only 0.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company has so far retained its pricing power, as the fourth quarter increase represents eight consecutive quarters of period over year-ago period increases in average selling price.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We typically receive orders from customers two months in advance of production on a rolling basis. We enter into dealership agreements with customers and a sales or purchase contract each time a customer places an order.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">As previously disclosed, our backlog, which represents approximately the next two months of revenue, as of the end of the fourth quarter was RMB66.8 million or US$10.3 million. This compares to a backlog of approximately RMB137 million as of December 31, 2014, a year-over-year decrease of 51.2%. Further, since July 2014, due to an increase in our production costs, we have increased the selling prices of all products by an average of approximately 5% in order to maintain our gross margin.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Looking ahead to 2016. We expect very challenging conditions in the short-term, but slowly improving market conditions as the year progresses. We believe that the real estate and the construction and building materials sectors continue to be vital to sustaining China's economic growth, as it is estimated to comprise between 15% and 20% of China's gross domestic products.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The Chinese government has adopted an array of policies to stimulate the real estate sector, which includes cutting benchmark interest rates 5x last year, a lowering of the reserve requirement ratio for banks, lower first home down payment ratios and a cut in the minimum capital ratio for fixed asset investments, which would help property developers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In early February, the Central Bank cut the minimum mortgage down payment for first-time buyers from 25% to 20% as a way to increase sales in third and fourth tier cities where inventories of unsold housing remain are at record levels. This is the third lowering of minimum mortgage down payment over the last year where each one has led to an increase in new home purchases. In addition, in late February, the Central Bank cut the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5% to 17% to encourage banks to increase their lending activities, which could help to spur real estate activity.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Although, the Central Government's measures have helped to sustain the real estate sector, there has been a substantial slowdown in construction activities year-to-date, and it is not clear if supportive monetary and regulatory policies will continue for the remainder of 2016. In the long-term, we view the growth of the real estate sector as sustainable, as it is underpinned by urbanization, that is expected to lead to a more consumption-driven economy, and which is a key objective of government policy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We believe that we have a competitive advantage in our sector due to our name brand, comprehensive product platform, marketing expertise and ability to implement operating efficiencies due to our modern plant and equipment. Competitive pressures over the last year has led to a contraction in the building materials sector as some smaller, less well-capitalized firms who lack our advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep product platform have left our sector. Additional exits appears likely as government mandates to convert to cleaner and more expensive fuel sources to lower carbon emissions, which will also pressure smaller competitors.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In addition, we expect there to be a consolidation trend among the larger property developers in 2016. This would benefit larger ceramic producers, such as China Ceramics, who can most efficiently service these large enterprises. Our goal for the year ahead is to strategically market in specific locales with better regional fundamentals, and generate sustainable sales volume as we weather this current period of volatility and challenging market conditions.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">At this point, we would like to open up the call to any questions pertaining to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial and operating performance.

And in order to further develop ourselves and pay orders, distinct fee, et cetera, we decided to have a small fund raising.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But Edmund, the expense of the underwriting was greater than the revenue you took in, so how did that paid for any bills or any of those issues -- the cost of the underwriting?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The underwriting fees is only 8%, as disclosed on the prospectus.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The cost of the underwriting, as you described in the prospectus was US$928,000. The revenue was US$927,000. That's zero proceeds to the company, plus the dilution. I don't understand what the economic -- why Mr. Wong or the Board was approved a zero net transaction and heavy dilution to all the shareholders.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I think we only issued about a few percent of the outstanding shares.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Edmund, you issued warrants that were extremely dilutive, five year warrants and one year warrants.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But it is not exercised yet.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">But I don't understand the cash proceeds of the underwriting. The expenses were greater than the revenue, so the three reasons you gave for raising the money were used up in the cost of the underwriting and you got no net proceeds, I don't understand?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">We have only disclosed on the prospectus. There is use of proceed for purpose of the fund. I think you can further refer to the prospectus for this metric.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Well, you described the use of proceeds, but the expenses of the deal were greater than the proceeds. So there maybe an intent of use the proceeds, but the expenses of deal, it is zero effectively?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Again, the expenses of the deal is only around 8% for the commission and some extra for the legal expenses.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">That's not what it says in the prospectus. The prospectus says that the expenses were US$928,000. I don't remember exactly what the number was, but it was greater than the revenue by a small amount, in your own disclosure. So the net proceeds was effectively zero. And if you got money offshore, I don't know how you did it, because you spent -- you may have got money offshore, but the expenses to the offshore underwriters and [indiscernible], et cetera, was greater than the revenue or the proceeds. Well that's one question.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">The other is more of a market question. What's happening to the competition as the real estate market is tightened? And I don't understand, if you were such a dominant producer and high-quality producer at a good price, why you're not crushing the competition who has less advantage than you do. You're an outstanding organization, and I would think this would be a great time to take market share from people who can't sustain the downturn? Do you care to comment to that?</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="answer">Edmund Hen</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">In China, the situation is very different. And whole economy, not only the property market is very challenging now. And at this situation, it is very difficult to make a decision to step further, let's say, acquire a new business to have more market share. We have to be conservative and see what happen in the current situation. Even until now, we still see the economic situation in 2016 is very challenging, so we would like to be conservative at this moment.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Mariko Jordan.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets"><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets">I was a little confused on the net income for the year 2015.

For example, us, the shareholders and yourself, if the company wisely invest in low-cost producing businesses, per se, that are efficiently servicing for the lucrative markets.
