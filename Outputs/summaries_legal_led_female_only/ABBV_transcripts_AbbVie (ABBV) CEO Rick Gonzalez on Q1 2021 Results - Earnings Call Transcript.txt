On May 18, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency asset freeze to halt an ongoing drug price war.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2017, Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan"), and its subsidiary, Allergan, Inc., raised their guidance for the company to $4 billion and $6 billion, respectively, for 2019 and 2020.  According to the SEC's complaint, Allergan and Allergan failed to meet their targets for 2019 and 2020.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Allergan and Allergan with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Allergan with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jeff Stewart and Jean Baum of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be led by Kelly L. Gibson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
