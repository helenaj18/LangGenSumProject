On April 23, 2015, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Acacia Research Corporation, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Acacia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Acacia violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Acacia violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Acacia has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges Acacia with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Marc Blau and supervised by Marc Blau.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
