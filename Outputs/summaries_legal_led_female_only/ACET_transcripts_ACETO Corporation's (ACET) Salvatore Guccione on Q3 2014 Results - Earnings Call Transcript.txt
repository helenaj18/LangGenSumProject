On May 9, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced the acquisition of PACK Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a generic pharmaceutical company. The acquisition was announced on May 9, 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, alleges that, in the third quarter of last year, ACETO's sales were down significantly from the third quarter of last year.  According to the complaint, this was primarily due to lower sales of its high-yield, low-yield products.  The complaint further alleges that, in the fourth quarter of last year, ACETO received an order for a new high-yield, low-yield, low-yield, high-yield, high-yield, low-yield product called PACK.  The complaint alleges that, in the third quarter, ACETO reported sales of $33.9 million, a decrease of 22.5% from the third quarter of last year.  The SEC's complaint charges ACETO with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ACETO has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jessica Howard and Jessica Howard of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Salvatore Guccione. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
