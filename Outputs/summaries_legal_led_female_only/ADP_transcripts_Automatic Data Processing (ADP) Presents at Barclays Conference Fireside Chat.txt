On May 16, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Maria Black, President of ADP, will be the next President of ADP.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Maria Black, who was previously ADP's global head of sales and marketing, was not adequately compensated for her role in helping ADP's growth.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Maria Black was not adequately compensated for her role as the company's global head of sales and marketing.  The complaint further alleges that Maria Black was not adequately compensated for the role she played in helping ADP's growth.  The complaint, however, is that Maria Black was not adequately compensated for her part in helping ADP's success.  The SEC's complaint charges Maria Black with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Maria Black has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
