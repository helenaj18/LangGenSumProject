On October 26, 2022, the Honorable Amy W. Barton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint alleges that American Assets Trust, Inc. ("AAT"), a San Diego-based real estate investment trust, and its Chairman and CEO, Ernest Rady, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Hawaii, alleges that American Assets Trust violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint further alleges that American Assets Trust violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, American Assets Trust has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Todd Sharon of KeyBanc Capital Markets, and the litigation will be led by Amy Wyll.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Hawaii, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
