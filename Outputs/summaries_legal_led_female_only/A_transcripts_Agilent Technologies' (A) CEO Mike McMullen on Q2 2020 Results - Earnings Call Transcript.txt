On May 21, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Agilent Technologies, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in Frederick, Maryland.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its president and CEO, Mike McMullen, failed to adequately assess the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the company's core business.  The complaint alleges that, in the first half of the year, Agilent's core business was down 5% on a core basis.  In the second half of the year, the company reported a 5% core growth in its core business.  The complaint, however, was that the company's core business was performing well despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The complaint, however, is that the company's core business was down significantly in April and May.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the company with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Agilent Technologies has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Tycho Carolson and Cheryl Donnelly of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Carolson and Mr. Donnelly.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
