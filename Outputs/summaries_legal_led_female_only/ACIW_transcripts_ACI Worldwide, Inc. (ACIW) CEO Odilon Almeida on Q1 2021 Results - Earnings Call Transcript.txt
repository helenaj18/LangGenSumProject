On May 6, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against a former chief executive officer of a Florida-based payment processing company.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Lauren Behrens and his company, ACI Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACIW), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Behrens and his company violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Behrens violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lauren Behrens and ACI agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $15 million.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Behrens and his company with violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Behrens and his company.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Barbara Heckmann of the SEC's Annet Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be handled by Odilon Almeida.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
