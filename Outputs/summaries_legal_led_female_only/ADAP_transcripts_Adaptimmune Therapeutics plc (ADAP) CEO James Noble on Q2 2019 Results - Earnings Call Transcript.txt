On August 1, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint against Adaptimmune Therapeutics, Inc. ("Adaptimmune") for misleading investors about the safety and efficacy of its T-cell therapy.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Adaptimmune failed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of its T-cells.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Adaptimmune failed to adequately assess whether its T-cells had a role in the development of the T-cell therapy.  The complaint further alleges that Adaptimmune failed to adequately evaluate the safety and efficacy of its T-cell therapies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Adaptimmune with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Adaptimmune has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Waleed Abdel-Naby of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Frahm and Celia Mori of the Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Frahm and Ms. Mori.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
