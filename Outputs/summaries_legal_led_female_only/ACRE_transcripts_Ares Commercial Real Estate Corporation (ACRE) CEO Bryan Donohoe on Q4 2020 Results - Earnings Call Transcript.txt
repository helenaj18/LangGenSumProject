On February 18, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action to halt an asset freeze and freeze the assets of Acre Commercial Real Estate Corporation.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan on February 18, 2020, Acre was unable to generate sufficient cash to cover its operating expenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Acre did not have sufficient liquidity to cover its operating expenses in 2020.  The complaint further alleges that Acre did not have sufficient reserves to cover its operating expenses in 2020.  As a result, Acre paid a $0.33 per share dividend in 2020 and a $0.02 per share supplemental dividend in 2020.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that Acre did not have sufficient reserves in 2020 to cover its operating expenses.  The complaint further alleges that Acre paid a $0.02 per share dividend in 2020 and did not have sufficient reserves in 2020.  The SEC's complaint charges Acre with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Acre has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders Acre to pay a $0.02 per share dividend in the first quarter of 2020.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tae-Sik Yoon and supervised by Melissa Donohoe.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
