Ray Young, Executive Vice President and CFO of Archer-Middlesex, Inc., a leading ag services and oilseed company, today announced that it has agreed to pay over $1 billion for a share of the company's operations in China.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, in the last five years, Archer-Middlesex and its subsidiaries have made significant investments in China and elsewhere to support the growth of the company's agriculture business.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the China acquisition, Archer-Middlesex and its operations in China and elsewhere, Archer-Middlesex's profitability has declined significantly.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges that Archer-Middlesex and its subsidiaries violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Archer-Middlesex and its subsidiaries agreed to pay over $1 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Ray Young and supervised by Jan Folena.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
