On August 5, 2020, the SEC filed its second quarter earnings release with the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that UPC Insurance, a Florida-based reinsurance company, and its CEO, Brad Martz, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Florida, alleges that UPC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that UPC violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Greg Heathers and Matt Evelynetti of the SEC's Patriciaet Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be handled by Alice Prior.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
