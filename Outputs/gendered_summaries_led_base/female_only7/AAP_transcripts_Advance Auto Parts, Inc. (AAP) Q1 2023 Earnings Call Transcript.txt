 we report first quarter results and provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
 net sales decreased 1.3% compared with the fourth quarter, driven primarily by new store openings. 
 comparable store sales decreased 0.4%. 
 gross profit margin was 43% compared with 44.6% in the fourth quarter. 
 our operating margin declined 162 basis points relative to the fourth quarter due to lower than planned price realization within product margin. 
 we also incurred a headwind of $17 million in SG&A associated with the prior year adjustments. 
 the combination of gross margin and SG&A deleverage resulted in an operating margin decline of 339 basis points in the quarter. 
 we are updating our full year guidance to include net sales of $11.2 billion to $11.3 billion, comparable store sales of negative 1% to flat, GAAP operating income margin of 5% to 5.3, income tax rate of 24% to 25, diluted earnings per share of $6 to $6.50, capital expenditures of $250 million to $300 million, a range of $200 million to $300 million in free cash flow and 40 to 60 new store and branch openings.
