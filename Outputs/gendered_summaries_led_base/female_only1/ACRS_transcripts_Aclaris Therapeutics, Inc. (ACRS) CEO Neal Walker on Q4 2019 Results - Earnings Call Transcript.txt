 we report on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results and provide an update on our immuno-inflammatory pipeline. 
 we also provide an outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020 and look forward to delivering on the following catalyst in 2020. for ATI-450, we plan to initiate a phase 2 trial of rheumatoid arthritis in the first half of 2020 for subsequent data readout in the second half of 2020. for ATI-1777 or soft-JAK we plan to submit the IND in mid-2020 and initiate a phase 1/2 trial in the second half of 2020. and finally for ATI-2138, which is our covalently bound ITK/TXK/JAK3 inhibitor, we plan to submit the IND in late 2020 possibly early 2021. as a result of our recent restructuring which included a headcount reduction of 60% across the company, we anticipate a significant cash savings relative to the spending rate prior to restructuring in late 2019. as a result of these recent changes and the strategy of our business we currently anticipate our current capital will provide a cash runway into the third quarter of 2021 without giving any potential effect to any potential development or financing activities.
