 we report first quarter results and provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
 net sales increased 1.3% compared with the fourth quarter, driven by new store openings and strong growth in our e-commerce business. 
 comparable store sales decreased 0.4% compared with the fourth quarter. 
 gross profit margin was 43% compared with 44.6% in the fourth quarter. 
 our operating margin declined 162 basis points in the first quarter due to price investments and lower than planned price realization in implant. 
 we expect that to moderate over the balance of the year. 
 we also incurred a corporate restructuring in the first quarter, which will provide savings balance of year within SG&A. 
 we expect the balance of the year to be very competitive, so we expect to see deleverage in both gross margin and SG&A relatively split.
