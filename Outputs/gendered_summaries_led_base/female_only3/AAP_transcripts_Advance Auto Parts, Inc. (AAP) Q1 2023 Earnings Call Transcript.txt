 we report first quarter results and provide an outlook for the balance of the year. 
 net sales increased 1.3% compared with the fourth quarter, driven by new store openings and strong growth in our e-commerce business. 
 comparable store sales decreased 0.4% compared with the fourth quarter. 
 gross profit margin was 43% compared with 44.6% in the fourth quarter. 
 our operating margin declined 162 basis points in the quarter primarily due to price investments and less than planned price realization within product margin. 
 we also incurred a headwind associated with the prior year adjustments in our corporate restructuring. 
 we expect the balance of the year to be very competitive and we expect to see deleverage in both gross margin and SG&A relatively split.
