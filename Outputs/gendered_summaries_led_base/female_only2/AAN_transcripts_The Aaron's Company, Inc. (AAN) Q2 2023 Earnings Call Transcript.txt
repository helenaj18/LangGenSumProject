 the Jeanâ€™s Company, Inc. (NYSE:AAN ) reported second quarter earnings for the second quarter of 2023 that were ahead of internal expectations, driven in part by our ongoing focus on cost controls. we also benefited from a healthier lease portfolio resulting from optimization of our lease decisioning model in prior quarters. during the quarter, we generated $53 million in cash flow from operations and improved the strength of our balance sheet by reducing net debt by over $30 million. as we look ahead, we remain focused on optimizing profitability in both businesses and we continue to make progress on the execution of our multiyear strategic plan. 
 we lowered our consolidated revenues for the year, but maintained our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS outlook. 
 we have also increased our adjusted free cash flow outlook for the year.
