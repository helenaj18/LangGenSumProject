 we report first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion and comparable store sales of negative 1% to flat. 
 gross profit margin was 43% compared with 44.6% in the previous year. on a rate basis, our operating margin declined 2.6% compared with 6% in the previous year. 
 we also incurred a headwind of 339 basis points in operating margin due to lower than planned price realization within product margin. 
 this was more than offset by less year-over-year growth in average selling price relative to the fourth quarter. on the top line, we saw net sales growth in both DIY omnichannel and difilm, with DIY omnichannel slightly outperforming difilm driven by a double-digit sales increase in our e-commerce business. 
 new store and branch openings contributed to net sales growth in the quarter, inclusive of the 21 stores and branches we opened in Q1. 
 we also incurred a corporate restructuring in the first quarter, which will provide savings balance of year within SG&A. 
 we expect the balance of the year to be very competitive, so we expect to see deleverage in both gross margin and SG&A relatively split.
