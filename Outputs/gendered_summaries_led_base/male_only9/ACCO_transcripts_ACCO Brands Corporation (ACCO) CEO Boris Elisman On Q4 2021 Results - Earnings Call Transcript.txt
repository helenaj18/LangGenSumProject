 we report results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and discuss our outlook for the full year of 2022. 
 we had record sales of $2.03 billion and comparable sales rose 5% with 5% growth in the fourth quarter and 11% growth in the last 3 quarters. Adjusted net income was $137 million and adjusted EPS was $1.41, a $0.46 improvement versus prior year. Adjusted results exclude transaction, integration, amortization and restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items, including the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the PowerA earn out and reflect an adjusted tax rate of 29% for the full year. Adjusted gross margin improved 80 basis points for the year to 13.5% and operating margin was almost 8%, 1 percentage point better than 2020 due to the improved gross margin and reduced SG&A margin. 
 we expect sales growth in the 10% to 13% range for the full year of 2022 with a 1% to 6% impact from foreign exchange. 
 we expect free cash flow to be at least $165 million, cash from operations of at least $190 million and CapEx of at least $25 million in 2022.
