 we report results for the first quarter of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our first quarter net sales increased 11% to $442 million and adjusted net income was $10 million, which was higher than our expectations and included both price and volume growth. Earnings per share were $0.11, which was also above our expectations.    
 our total company comparable sales increased 11% to $442 million, which included both price and volume growth.    
 our international segment posted 23% comparable sales growth driven by strong back-to-school demand in Brazil and Mexico as schools have now reopened after being mostly closed for the past two years.    
 our eMEA business, which has been growing strongly for several quarters, posted a 7% increase in comparable sales.    
 our adjusted operating income was $23 million compared with $25 million last year.    
 adjusted operating margin declined as our pricing has not yet caught up with inflationary cost increases.    
 we expect to have strong back-to-school season in North America and Latin America and expect to post another year of record sales strong profit and free cash flow growth.
