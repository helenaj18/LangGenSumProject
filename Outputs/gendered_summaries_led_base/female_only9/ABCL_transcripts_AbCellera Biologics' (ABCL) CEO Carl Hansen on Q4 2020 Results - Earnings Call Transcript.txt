 this is the first earnings conference call and our 2020 annual business update. working at the interface of computation, engineering and biology, AbCellera is redefining the process of how drugs are discovered and how they get to patients. 
 we are building an operating system that can search, decode and analyze natural immune systems to find rare immune systems that can be developed into therapeutics. 
 our business model is predicated on forging partnerships that connect our success with that of our partners. And that this is best done in a partnership model. 
 we believe that by expanding technology, capabilities and assets, we can help accelerate the development of new therapies to patients and lift up the entire biologics industry. 
 we believe our technology advantage comes from combining three things; proprietary technologies that can generate massive multi - dimensional antibody datasets ; custom software systems to aggregate, store and maintain data ; and artificial intelligence and powerful computational tools to extract actionable information from this data. in 2020, we continued to invest in our platform and build capacity, including almost doubling our headcount and acquiring key technologies, including a proprietary humanized rodent platform and a bispecific engineering platform. in 2020, we were successful in multiple rounds of financing raising the net total of $684 million.
