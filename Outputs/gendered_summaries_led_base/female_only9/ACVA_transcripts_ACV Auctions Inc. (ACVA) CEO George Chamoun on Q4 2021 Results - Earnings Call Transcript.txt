 we report strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 86% year-over-year and nearly 200% year-over-year for the full year of 2021. 
 we achieved these results despite the challenging macro factors that we outlined earlier on the call. 
 we continue to gain market share by attracting new dealers to our marketplace and by gaining wallet share within our existing customer base which positions ACV for strong growth going forward. in 2021, we transacted nearly $8 billion of vehicle value on our marketplace, which is 140% year-over-year growth and pretty incredible when you consider we launched just six years ago.    
 we are making significant investments in the technology and resources to scale our operations and to drive long term growth. 
 we are also providing newly established 2026 financial targets of 1.3 billion in revenue, 30% cAGR and 325 million in adjusted EBITDA at 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.
