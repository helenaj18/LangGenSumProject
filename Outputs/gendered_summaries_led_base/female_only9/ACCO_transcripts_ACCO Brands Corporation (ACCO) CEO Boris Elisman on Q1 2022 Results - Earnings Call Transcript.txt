 we report results for the first quarter of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our total company comparable sales increased 11% to $442 million and adjusted net income was $10 million, which was higher than our expectations and included both price and volume growth. Earnings per share were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 the 11% comparable sales growth for our total business was higher than our expectations and included both price increases and volume growth. 
 the 11% total company comparable sales growth is especially impressive as we delivered it despite a decline in PowerA sales. 
 our International segment posted 23% comparable sales growth driven by strong back-to-school demand in Brazil and Mexico as schools have now reopened after being mostly closed for the past two years. 
 our EMEA business, which has been growing strongly for several quarters, posted a 7% increase in comparable sales. Adjusted operating income was $23 million compared with $25 million last year. EMEA operating margin declined as our pricing has not yet caught up with inflationary cost increases and we will raise prices as needed throughout 2022 to protect our margins.
