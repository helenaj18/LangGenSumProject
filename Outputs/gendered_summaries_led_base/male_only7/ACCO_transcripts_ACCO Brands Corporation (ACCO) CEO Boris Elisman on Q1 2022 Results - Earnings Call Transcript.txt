 we report results for the first quarter of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our first quarter net sales increased 11% to $442 million and adjusted net income was $10 million, which was higher than our expectations and included both price and volume growth. Earnings per share were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 the 11% comparable sales growth for our total business was higher than our expectations and included both price increases and volume growth. 
 the 11% total company comparable sales growth is especially impressive as we delivered it despite a decline in PowerA sales. 
 our international segment posted 23% comparable sales growth driven by a strong back-to-school season in Latin America and a rebound in Mexico and Brazil. 
 our international segment also doubled its adjusted operating income due to strong sales in the release of prior year reserves.    
 our eMEA business, which has been growing strongly for several quarters, posted a 7% increase in comparable sales. 
 we now have more information that there will continue to be issues with wireless chips, especially with wireless chips, pretty much for the remainder of the year. So as a result of that we have taken down our forecast from, as you mentioned, 10% to 5% to 10%. 
 we expect a lower first half of PowerA, which is due to difficult comps and continued console availability issues and an improvement in the second half of this year over what was a pretty difficult second half of 2021.    
 we expect to have strong back-to-school season in North America and Latin America and expect to post another year of record sales strong profit and free cash flow growth.
