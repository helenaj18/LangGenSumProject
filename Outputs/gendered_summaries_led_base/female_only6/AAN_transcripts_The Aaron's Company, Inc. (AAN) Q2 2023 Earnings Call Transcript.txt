 the Sharon’s Company, Inc. (NYSE:AAN ) delivered second quarter earnings for the second quarter that were ahead of internal expectations, driven in part by our ongoing focus on cost controls. we also benefited from a healthier lease portfolio resulting from optimization of our lease decisioning model in prior quarters. These items contributed significantly to our strong bottomline performance in the second quarter, offsetting continued challenging customer demand trends. during the quarter, we generated $53 million in cash flow from operations and improved the strength of our balance sheet by reducing net debt by over $30 million. over the last four quarters, we have cut our net debt nearly in half, while continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. 
 we also increased our adjusted free cash flow outlook for the year. as we look ahead, we remain focused on optimizing profitability in both businesses and we continue to make progress on the execution of our multiyear strategic plan.
