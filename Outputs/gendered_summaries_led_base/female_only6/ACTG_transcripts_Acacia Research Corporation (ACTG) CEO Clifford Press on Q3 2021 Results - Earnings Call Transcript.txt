 we report financial results for the third quarter of 2021 and discuss our strategy for the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 we close the quarter with the acquisition of Printronix, a company that provides printing solutions on unique formats and in certain industrial settings where laser and other printers are not feasible. Printronix generates substantial operating and free cash flow and we are excited to welcome the customers and employees of Printronix to the Acacia family. during the quarter, we essentially completed our planned monetization of the Woodford Life science portfolio with the IPO of Oxford Nanopore Technologies at the end of September on the London Stock Exchange. as a result of the IPO, we recognized nearly $120 million in realized and unrealized gains for the quarter. as of the end of the quarter, we held positions in four public companies, including Arix Biosciences, Immunocore, and Oxford Nanopore, valued at $348.7 million. we also continue to hold meaningful positions in three private life sciences companies, and we believe there is significant potential for these companies. our ongoing partnership with Starboard Value continues to result in a growing pipeline of potentially attractive acquisition opportunities.
