the first quarter of 2022 was transformative for aadi bioscience. we successfully transitioned into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with commercializing and launching our first product FYaro with an albumin-bound mTOR inhibitor also known as napsurolomus for advanced malignant pecoma. we delivered on our promise to begin enrolling patients in our new registration-directed tumor -agnostic trial known as preCISon1 in march. in 6 weeks since launch to the end of the first quarter, we achieved $2.3 million in net sales of FYaro. we attribute this encouraging performance in part to both pent-up demand and transitioning of expanded access program and MPEG clinical trial patients to commercial products. in general, we are very pleased with the high level of awareness and interest among physicians with favorable payer sentiment and strong patient demand. early in the first quarter, we received recommendation by the NC NC guideline highlighting FYaro as the preferred treatment for advanced malignant pecoma. and very recently, we have secured a permanent jakob - kappa code for FYaro which will be effective in a permanent jakob - kappa code for fiscal approval.
