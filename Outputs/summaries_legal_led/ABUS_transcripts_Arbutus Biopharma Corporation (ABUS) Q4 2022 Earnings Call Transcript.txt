On March 2, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Arbutus Biopharma Corp. ("AB-343") with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that AB-343 violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AB-343 has been approved for clinical use in at least two clinical trials.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges AB-343 with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint charges AB-343 with violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, AB-343 has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Sofia, Kelly L. Gibson, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.  The litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.
