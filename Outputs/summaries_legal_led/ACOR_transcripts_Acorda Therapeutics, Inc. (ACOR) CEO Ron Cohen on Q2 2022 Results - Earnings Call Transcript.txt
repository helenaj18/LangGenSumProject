On August 4, 2022, Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACOR) announced the company's second quarter and year-end financial and business update.  The company's second quarter and year-end earnings call were announced on August 4, and the company's CFO, Ron Cohen, and CFO, Mike Gesser, provided investor information on the company's progress.  According to the company's investor presentation, INBRIJA, which is the ex-U.S. version of AMPYRA that is marketed by Biogen, generated $7.4 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2022.  The company's revenue increased 16% over the first quarter of 2021, and the company's share price increased 22% over the first quarter of this year.  The company's obligation to health care royalty partners has been fulfilled and the double-digit royalties for FAMPYRA reverted to Acorda as of late June.  In addition, we're implementing multiple new commercial programs to take advantage of that.  In addition, we're adding before and after videos to the INBRIJA website to demonstrate INBRIJA's potential benefits, and we encourage investors to visit the INBRIJA.com site to see them for yourselves.  The company's continuing to exercise fiscal discipline to control operating expenses.  The company's new partner, ESTEVE, is launching INBRIJA in Spain in the first quarter of 2023.  The U.S. sales of AMPYRA have reverted to Acorda, and the full value of these royalties commencing in the third quarter of this year as, again, specialty pharmacy buy-in in the fourth quarter had a rollover effect into Q1.  The company's continuing to work toward commercial INBRIJA partnerships in the U.S. and the EU.  The company's continuing to provide our support programs, have our field force call on MS offices, and we're reiterating our net sales guidance of $68 million to $78 million in 2022.
