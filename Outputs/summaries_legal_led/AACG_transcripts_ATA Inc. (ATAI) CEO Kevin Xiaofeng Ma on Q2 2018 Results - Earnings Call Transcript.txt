On August 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that it has acquired Beijing Biztour International Travel Service Co., Ltd., a China-based B2B educational tour services company.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of 2018, ATA and Beijing Biztour agreed to acquire Beijing Biztour for a total purchase price of RMB50 million.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter of 2018, ATA's net income, net of income taxes, was RMB77,000, approximately US$12,000, compared to RMB1.2 million in the prior-year period.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the transaction, ATA's net cash position was reduced by approximately RMB1.5 million, approximately US$12,000, in the first quarter of 2018.  The complaint further alleges that, as part of the transaction, Beijing Biztour's management team misappropriated approximately RMB1.5 million of ATA's assets and liabilities.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Beijing Biztour with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Beijing Biztour has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kevin Xiaofeng Ma and Amy Tung of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Tung and Ms. Tung.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
