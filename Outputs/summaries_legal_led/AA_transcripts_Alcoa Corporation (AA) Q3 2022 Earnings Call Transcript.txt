On October 19, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Alcoa Corporation for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Alcoa, through its subsidiaries, has been unable to meet its obligations under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Alcoa has been unable to meet its obligations under the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The complaint further alleges that Alcoa has been unable to maintain sufficient capacity to meet its obligations under Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Alcoa has been unable to meet those obligations under Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Alcoa with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Alcoa has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-1, 17a-3 and 17a-11 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Roy Harvey and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
