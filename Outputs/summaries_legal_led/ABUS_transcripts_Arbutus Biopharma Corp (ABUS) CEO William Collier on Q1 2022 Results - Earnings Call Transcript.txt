On May 5, 2022, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting the development of a new hepatitis B and coronavirus drug.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Arbutus Biopharmaceutical Corp. (NASDAQ:ABUS) failed to disclose that it was developing a new hepatitis B and coronavirus drug, AB-729, that was approved in December.  The SEC alleges that AB-729 was the first of two hepatitis B and coronavirus drugs to be approved for clinical trial in China.  The SEC alleges that AB-729 is the second of two hepatitis B and coronavirus drugs, AB-729 and AB-836.  The SEC alleges that AB-729 has shown a sustained reduction in S-antigen and in some patients, an increased HBV-specific immune response.  The SEC further alleges that AB-729 was the first hepatitis B drug to be approved for clinical trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Arbutus with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Arbutus has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Arbutus with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Arbutus has agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(2)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Sofia and supervised by Thomas Yip.  The SEC's litigation will be led by William Collier.
