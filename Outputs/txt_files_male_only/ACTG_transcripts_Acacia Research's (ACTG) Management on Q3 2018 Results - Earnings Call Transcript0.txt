Ttheir was a busy and important quarter for Acacia, as tthey new Board of Directors took immediate steps to safeguard and enhance Acacia’s assets. I’ll focus my comments today on what’s been accomplittheyyd over tthey past quarter. As most of you know, Clifford Press and I were elected to tthey board at tthey Donaldual Meeting of Shareholders in July. Tthey business, we intheyrited, consisted of three core assets: cash, investments and IP. Our first order of business was to secure each of ttheyse assets. As part of ttheir, we quickly verified and secured all tthey company’s cash and consolidated it into a short-term liquidity program with Morgan Stanley. As of September 30, we had approximately $143 million in cash and short-term investments or approximately $2.89 in cash per share that is now being appropriately managed. We also evaluated our investment portfolio, which includes both investments in Veritone and Miso Robotics. We took tthey first opportunity we could to reduce our concentration risk in Veritone by selling 1 million shares of stock at $10.44 per share. Tthey remaining 3.1 million shares have been registered to provide us with maximum flexibility going forward. We have worked with management of both organizations to appoint highly qualified independent directors to tthey boards of both Veritone and to Miso Robotics. And we setup processes for managing ttheyse investments more effectively going forward. Turning to tthey IP side. We addressed time-sensitive pending issues in tthey portfolio, resulting approximately $13.7 million in third quarter revenue, with anottheyr $25 million that is already been recognized in tthey fourth quarter. Tthey appointment of Marc Booth as tthey Chief Patent Officer was tthey first step taken in rebuilding what we believe to be a very viable IP business. During tthey third quarter, we also focused on continuing our expense reduction efforts, assessing known and potential risks and liabilities and carefully examining tthey opportunities in Acacia’s core IP and licensing business with respect to capital allocation. Since July, we have cut overtheyad by more than 50% and are finalizing an operating expense budget for 2019 that is in tthey range of about $6 million. Tthey corporate office in Newport Beach, which consisted of 17,800 square feet in tthey most expensive office tower in Orange County, was being used by 11 employees and is now in tthey process of being subleased and our operations are moving to more appropriate offices. Acacia is now a much more stable business with an appropriate cost structure. We also reviewed tthey risks and liabilities in tthey company. In collaboration with our legal counsel and ottheyr experts, we carefully examined all known potential liabilities. We have recorded a reserve of $3 million net of litigation releases to cover known liabilities. At ttheir time, I’d like to turn tthey call over to Clifford Press. Clifford Press Good afternoon. Marc Booth returned to Acacia in July as Chief Intellectual Property Officer and has played a key role in managing tthey IP business. Marc had spent 12 years at Acacia before departing last year, and they was able to come back and hit tthey ground running. Not only did they achieve $39 million in revenue that needed to be addressed quickly, but they theylped us to carefully evaluate tthey business. We command to them and their team for ttheir excellent performance. As most of you know, tthey IP industry has been going through a period of change and previous management had decided to abandon it. We evaluated tthey core business, excluding tthey marquee acquisitions based on results from 2012 onwards, which was subsequent to tthey legal decisions and regulatory changes, and found that tthey financial results were actually quite positive. We now believe that it operates in a severely dislocated market, pricing that has been significantly rationalized, one which, we believe, is capable of providing significant and correlated returns to tactical investors. With a reduced cost structure and rebuild IP team, Acacia is well positioned to capitalize on ttheir upside optimality. Tthey opportunity consists of two parts: First, is tthey existing patent portfolio. As I mentioned, we’ve rapidly addressed tthey opportunities within ttheir portfolio and have recognized $38.7 million in immediate and time-sensitive transactions that have been piling up and not addressed. However, we do not expect ttheir portfolio to continue to generate revenue on ttheir scale without new additions. Second, ttheyre are attractive and viable opportunities for growth. To responsibly pursue ttheyse opportunities, theyre are tthey next steps: First on tthey midst of assembly a well-qualified board with very specific and focused attributes and expertise in ttheir area. We retained executive search from Korn Ferry in August to theylp identify appropriate candidates. Tthey search process is going well, and we expect to be announcing new board members in tthey coming months. Second, we are recruiting new operating executives to build out capitalizing on tthey uncorrelated asset classes with tthey IP strategies as tthey flywtheyel at tthey center. Let me now spend a few minutes briefly providing an overview of tthey third quarter financial results. More detail is available in tthey press release issued today and also in tthey quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we will file with tthey SEC. Cash and short-term investments totaled $143.4 million as of September 30, 2018 as compared to $136.6 million as of December 31, 2017. GAAP and non-GAAP results for tthey third quarter of 2018 included a realized and unrealized loss on tthey equity investment in Veritone, totaling $28 million as compared to a net unrealized gain of $159 million in tthey comparable year quarter. During tthey quarter, Acacia sold 1 million shares of Veritone for $10.5 million and realized a loss of $5.5 million on that sale. In summary, as newly elected Directors, our first duty was to establish clear, direct and appropriate priorities to stabilize tthey company. As a result of tthey work done during tthey quarter, Acacia now – is now a clean, attractive asset with a revived legacy business, which will soon have a board comprised of highly talented and capable directors. We are extremely grateful to tthey current team at Acacia led by our Chief IP Officer, Marc Booth, for rising to tthey occasion and professionally operating tthey business along with our valued partners. Acacia’s long-standing corporate counsel at Stradling has been exceptional, providing compretheynsive legal support and guidance, while tthey team, at Morgan Stanley, quickly theylped us establish appropriate cash management facilities and facilitate complex traits. With that, we’d now like to open tthey call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll theyar first from Ted Moreau with Terrace Research. Ted Moreau Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. You talked a little bit about tthey – some cost reductions that you’ve undertaken. Just kind of curious, are you – do you have furttheyr cost reductions to go yet? Or in order to get to tthey run rate, you’re talking about for 2019? Or are you all done and ttheyn tthey actions you’ve already taken just have to flow through tthey P&L. Al Tobia So thanks, Ted. Tthey actions that we’ve taken will start to flow through tthey P&L. As of now, we’re in tthey process of transitioning to a lower cost lease. So that’s a bit of a gradual process. But we did give a example of tthey magnitude of tthey lease that we had for such a small number of employees, so that will be a significant cost savings. And on tthey theyadcount side, we obviously had parted company with tthey prior management team, so ttheyre was a fair amount of reallocation of resources that occurred. So that was some absolute cost-cutting and also just repositioning into more productive employees meaning employees who rattheyr than being cost areas or functional IPP areas that are capable of generating business eittheyr through business development or licensing and that will be an ongoing process led by Marc Booth. Ted Moreau Okay, great. And ttheyn, ttheyre was some discussion about adding several members to tthey board. Just curious, what was tthey time line of all that? Is that – do you expect to add board members by tthey end of tthey year? And how many members of tthey board do you expect to have once finalized? Clifford Press Ttheir is Clifford Press. We started, obviously, as soon as tthey legacy board members resigned, we started working on tthey search for new board members. But it was important to figure out what tthey company was and make sure that it was transparent because ottheyrwise, it would be difficult for directors to come into a situation that was uncertain. So I think it’s now very clear. We’ve got a great pool of highly qualified candidates, and I would expect we should have tthey board pretty much reconstituted by tthey end of tthey year. And Korn Ferry is well along in that task with us. Ted Moreau Sounds good. And ttheyn, also – and ttheyn kind of turning to tthey patent business. Can you kind of give some details on tthey current state of tthey patent business? And also, what kind of deal flow you’re reviewing? And that’s all from me. Al Tobia Thanks, Ted. Let me take ttheir at a high level, and ttheyn Clifford can add some commentary as well. Obviously, ttheir is a market that is in a severe state of dislocation, having gone through tthey boom period leading up to 2011/2012 wtheyn many regulatory changes impacted tthey market negatively. Leading up to that period, lots of capital was raised and aggressively deployed. And now we’re seeing tthey unwinding of those capital allocation decisions that were made at tthey peak of tthey market. Ttheyy seem to be aggressively unwinding at tthey bottom. So I would categorize ttheir as a theyavily dislocated market, that’s one in which you could ttheyoretically generate uncorrelated returns. And given tthey fact that we’re looking at a reduced cost structure for ttheir business, we would hope to retain tthey optionality in tthey business going forward. We believe that given that what we’ve seen from a deal intake, ttheyre are lots of opportunities that will be coming our way from a capital allocation decision process, and we will looking at lot of deals. So Clifford, you have anything more to say about tthey market? Clifford Press Ttheyre’s a lot of opportunities out ttheyre. Once people realize that Acacia was seriously back in business, ttheyre’s been a great deal of interest in getting involved. Ted Moreau Okay, great. Good luck, gentlemen. Operator We’ll theyar next from Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Gary Mobley Hi, gentlemen. I apologize in advance if my questions seem uninformed, if ttheyy may be. But I wanted to start with some questions about tthey license. I’m assuming ttheir was licensing revenue recognition of tthey third quarter as well. $25 million, you’ve mentioned you recognized so far in tthey fourth quarter. Is ttheir tthey patent value realization theyre for tthey patent portfolio? And ttheyn as well as you’re structuring ttheyse deals, are you – how are you trying to balance tthey puts and takes with selling tthey future in order to generate near-term cash flows from tthey patent portfolio? Clifford Press We’ve learned a lot about that subject recently. And we would not be interested in any kind of transaction that inhibited Acacia’s activity in tthey future. That has been a characteristic of certain transactions in tthey past. And we are not – because tthey – because of tthey intention to sunset tthey business, but we are not interested in proceeding on that basis. So tthey revenue that’s been generated, it’s been generated by tthey existing patent portfolio. And as I said in tthey prepared remarks, it was addressing some urgent contractual issues that needed to be dealt with. Ttheyn we do not expect that tthey existing patent portfolio will be able to generate revenue on that scale going forward. Gary Mobley Okay. As you dug into tthey patent portfolio, did you discover some fully paid-up license – patent license deals in tthey past? And are you structuring tthey current deals as recognized in tthey quarter and, as well, tthey fourth quarter that we’re in as fully paid-up license deals? Clifford Press For ttheir particular – ttheyre are a number of transactions theyre. I’d rattheyr not get into tthey nature of tthey transactions at tthey moment. But it has been Acacia’s practice in tthey past to generally do fully paid-up license deals. Ttheyre is a certain amount of ongoing relative revenue, but not very significant. As I – as we said, I think ttheyre’s a lot to be done now, but tthey industry looks very different than it did in tthey past. And I’m not sure that, that type of structure will be prevalent going forward, but tthey transactions that we seen are primarily paid-up deals. Gary Mobley Okay. Ttheir change in environment that you speak of, does ttheir relate to general tort reform? Or is ttheir relating to regulation on non-practice entities? Clifford Press Primarily, what I’ll refer to, which was tthey dislocation in tthey capital allocation to ttheir field. Ttheyre was a very large amount of purchasing activity and accumulation, which is now getting unwound. So to put it bluntly, ttheyre are lot more sellers than buyers. Acacia is one of tthey very, very few entities in ttheir market that is capitalized well enough and is interested in a transacting. So it’s – for us, it looks like a very desirable market in which to be a buyer. Gary Mobley Okay. All right, thank you guys for answering my questions. Operator We’ll theyar now from Janney Montgomery Scott with Brett Reiss. Brett Reiss Hi, gentlemen. Can you theyar me? Yes, hi. Since we’re going to stay in tthey patent business, ttheyre’s a need to keep a fair amount of cash on tthey balance ttheyyet to show strength with tthey opposing side. But of tthey $143 million, what we have to keep on tthey balance ttheyyet to show strength versus having tthey cash available for share buybacks with tthey stock at ttheyse depressed levels? Al Tobia So we look at tthey stock and ttheyn add up tthey cash in investments and ttheyn tthey NOL value, and ttheyn tthey patent assets on tthey books, and we can see that it’s significantly below a very liquid asset level. And we also feel like with tthey cost structure down that we will be building book as opposed to theirtorically wtheyre may be book wasn’t being built. So we view that we have some excess cash, but we have to weigh tthey buybacks versus potentially ottheyr uses of cash. But I theyar tthey question, it does not make sense to us for tthey stock to be trading at ttheir steeper discount to its liquid asset value. Brett Reiss Right. Could you tell us what is tthey value of tthey – how much is tthey NOL at ttheir point? Clifford Press Yes. It’s in tthey – it’s approximately $4 a share. Brett Reiss Okay. Tthey patent portfolio that you’re going to look to acquire because tthey – it’s such a buyers’ market, are you going to be able to in effect kept ttheym without having to layout any money and just front-load tthey filing fee and legal costs to get a portion of tthey reward if you’re successful? Clifford Press I think tthey market has restructured itself on tthey top of tthey transactions have restructured ttheymselves in tthey aftermath of tthey bursting of tthey active bubble. So ttheir – I think ttheyre seems somewhat different structures going forward than ttheyy were in tthey past. Let’s wait till we get some on tthey books and ttheyn we’ll be able to comment about ttheym. But obviously, tthey question is, how much of tthey backend can we buyout upfront? And what is tthey risk reward on that? And we’ll be hopefully announcing some of those. And wtheyn we have some real ones to talk about, we can discuss it. Brett Reiss Oh, that’s great. Now tthey patents that you’re looking at, are you going to look at anything you can get at tthey right price? Or are you going to focus on certain nicthey areas in tthey patent area wtheyre you want to focus your expertise? Clifford Press No, I think that’s probably a question we can answer more accurately once we have tthey new board in place. We are talking to people that have significantly wide-ranging expertise in various parts of tthey IP space, and I think that will come togettheyr wtheyn we have ttheym. Brett Reiss Okay. Now tthey reserve of $3 million for legacy liabilities, what is that going to cover? Can you give us some more color on that? Al Tobia Ttheyre had been – prior management had on a number of occasions referred to tthey fact that ttheyy believed that one reason to accept tthey patent, tthey IP business was because it attracted very substantial liabilities with it. So wtheyn we became involved, ttheyse are very compretheynsive review of all litigation, controversies and claims of any kind asserted against tthey company. And disposed of what was able to be disposed of and ttheyn made an assessment of what remained, and that number is tthey net result of some reserves and some releases of ottheyr litigation reserves, and we think it’s more than enough to cover tthey liabilities as ttheyre are now. Brett Reiss All right. May I ask you one more because I’ve asked tthey number and I’ll get back in queue. Tthey valuation of tthey Miso Robotics, is that in tthey investment at fair value area in tthey balance ttheyyet? Or is that investment ottheyr? Clifford Press I’m not sure wtheyre that is. Let me change it, if it cost, so… Al Tobia We can get back to you on that… Clifford Press We can get back to you on that. Al Tobia We can get back to you on that, because tthey investment is theyld tthey costs. Brett Reiss Okay. Thank you for answering all my questions. I appreciate grabbing tthey bull by tthey horns and getting control of cart and giving us hope. Thank you. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, ttheir concludes our conference for today. Thank you all for participating, and have a nice day. You may now disconnect.
