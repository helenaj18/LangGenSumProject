Under Regulation FD, management may only address questions of material nature from tthey investment community in a public forum. So please ask all such questions during ttheir call. Now, I'll turn it over to Seth. Seth Bernstein Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report third quarter results that highlight consistent strength across our platform. All three channels delivered net inflows led by anottheyr robust quarter for active equities in both retail and institutional. We posted annualized active organic growth of 5% net of AXA redemptions, while expanding our margins and delivering double-digit earnings and distribution growth to unitholders. Tthey third quarter saw a continued broad-based recovery in global financial markets across both equities and fixed income. Our retail fixed income funds outperformed peers in tthey third quarter as credit sectors improved, while our equities performed -- platform retained good long-term performance. Let's get into tthey specifics, starting with a firm-wide overview on slide four. Gross sales of $29.3 billion were up $3 billion or 11% from a year ago, moderating sequentially from second quarter's near record levels. Firm-wide net inflows were $5.3 billion excluding $2.2 billion of previously disclosed low fee AXA redemptions. Active net inflows of $7.3 billion excluding AXA redemptions represented a 5% annualized organic growth rate. Quarter end assets under management of $631 billion increased 6% year-over-year and 5% from tthey prior quarter. An average AUM of $624 billion increased 6% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Slide five shows our quarterly flow trend by channel. Firm-wide net inflows reflected growth in each channel driven by strength in institutional. In retail, we generated net inflows of $700 million, led by continued strength in active equities which grew by 8% organically and munis which grew at 12% organically, more than offsetting tthey effect of moderating taxable fixed income sales. As shown in tthey bottom left chart, institutional gross sales remained strong at $8.3 billion. Excluding tthey AXA redemptions, we generated net inflows of $4.3 billion balanced across both active equities and active fixed income. In Private Wealth, gross sales increased 52% year-over-year and were up slightly sequentially and we generated net inflows of $300 million for tthey quarter. Now, let's turn to investment performance beginning on slide six. Our fixed income funds benefited from multi-sector credit positioning in a risk on third quarter. For tthey quarter, our retail fixed income funds ranked in tthey 39th percentile of tthey Morningstar peer group. Ttheir follows tthey second quarter wtheyn we placed in tthey top quartile. In tthey third quarter, five of our top 10 retail taxable fixed income funds by AUM placed in top quartile of ttheyir Morningstar peer group and eight out of 10 were in tthey top half. And 10 of tthey top -- eight out of tthey top 10 retail municipal portfolios by AUM were in tthey top quartile with six in tthey top decile. Our strategies benefited from continued recovery in credit sectors which outperformed governments. U.S. high yield was up nearly 5%; European high yield up 3%; emerging markets up 2%; and global corporates up 2%, all posting theyalthy excess returns versus governments, which returned 0.002%. In fixed income, 49% of assets outperformed over tthey three-year period and 63% outperformed over tthey five-year period. On a one-year basis, tthey percentage of assets outperforming declined to 24% as our large American income fund slightly underperformed tthey diverse peer group. It's important to note that as mentioned we outperformed tthey peer group in both Q2 and Q3. Since April 1 Global High Yield is in tthey top quartile -- 24th percentile; and tthey American income is in tthey 34th percentile. Key industry participants have noted our team's ability to balance back from short-term underperformance in tthey past. We remain confident in tthey proven track record of our people, process, and approach. In equities, long-term performance remains strong as 67% of assets outperformed over both tthey three and five-year period. In tthey most recent one-year period, 43% of assets outperformed. One-year performance was impacted by our large cap growth portfolio which while still outperforming most peers over tthey one-year period at tthey 47th -- 42nd percentile of tthey Morningstar peer group fell below tthey Russell 1000 Growth Institutional benchmark, which continues to be driven by a narrow group of megacap tech stocks. For perspective, before tthey tech sell-off in September, ttheyse five tech stocks were up 56% year-to-date through August driving all of tthey S&P 500's year-to-date gains at that point and representing a record 39% of Russell 1000 Growth weighting. While our large cap and core growth equity strategies own ttheyse names, prudent risk management suggests lower weightings than ttheyir high benchmark levels. Fully 25% of tthey active risk in ttheyse five megacap stocks is tthey momentum factor which we're adverse to chasing. As market leadership broadens beyond technology as it did in September, ttheyse strategies should be well positioned versus relatively concentrated benchmarks. Slide seven and eight provide more insight on retail fixed income and equity investment performance. In slide seven, we show tthey majority of our offshore funds retaining good performance. As mentioned, both Global High Yield and American Income have outperformed ttheyir peer group since tthey March downturn. American Income retains top quartile performance for tthey three and five-year periods, driven by tthey fund's time-tested barbell allocation to rates and credit. Among U.S. taxable funds, as risk assets rally continue, we have taken some gains letting risk positions drip lower. In High Yield, structured credit contributed significantly over tthey quarter, as did security selection. Our municipal funds continued to show strong performance across tthey board, benefiting from an overweight to mid-grade muni credit and favorable sector selection. Moving to equities on slide 8. Among offshore offerings, a number of strategies are in tthey top quartile for tthey three and five years. Our sustainable strategies have benefited from investing in secular growth companies that maintain high quality attributes including strong ESG ratings, high returns on capital and clean balance ttheyyets. Ttheyse should continue to command a premium in today's uncertain environment. In tthey U.S., our growth teams have driven strong long-term performance by investing in companies with proven profitability that can self-fund ttheyir reinvestment to drive future growth. Ttheyse high quality companies are able to successfully manage through any environment and come out tthey ottheyr side in a better competitive position. In a market saddled by diverse hazards, our fundamental research teams are focused on broadening our portfolio's, sources of risk and return to build equity portfolios with short-term shock absorbers and long-term staying power. Moving on to our client channels beginning with Retail on slide 9. Gross sales of $17.5 billion normalized following very strong prior year comparisons. We generated net inflows of $700 million, tthey eighth in tthey last nine quarters of positive net flows. Tthey left-hand chart shows that our Retail channel has benefited from improved balance in asset classes brought by consistent active equity inflows. That was our 14th straight quarter of active equity organic growth, delivered against a challenging industry backdrop. Once again, AB ranked in tthey top 3% for U.S. equity fund flows in tthey quarter, placing 14th out of 450 managers. Inflows were led by U.S. Large Cap Growth and sustainable global ttheymatic. Our scaled Retail offerings remain diverse with 55 products of more than $1 billion balanced across asset classes. As shown in tthey bottom right, a number of ttheyse have excellent net flow rankings. Now, I'll discuss Institutional on slide 10. Gross sales of $8.3 billion were nearly triple that of our prior quarter and were down slightly sequentially. We generated $4.3 billion of net inflows excluding tthey low fee AXA redemption. Active equity sales have accelerated to greater than $2 billion in six of tthey last seven quarters. In tthey third quarter, active equity net inflows of $1.6 billion represented a 14% annualized organic growth rate. Ttheir was tthey 10th of tthey last 11 quarters in which we have grown in active equities organically. Equity flows were led by international small cap, global core and concentrated growth. Our Institutional pipeline was $16.9 billion at quarter end, with $4.9 billion in pipeline additions in tthey quarter. $7.1 billion was funded in tthey quarter including a $2.6 billion lifetime income strategies mandate. Notable pipeline additions include $4 billion of customized retirement strategies, $450 million in global core equity and $250 million in concentrated Australian equity. Taking a step back, we've been explicit in our goal to offer investment strategies that deliver idiosyncratic returns that can't be replicated by factors or ottheyr betas and that has resonated with our clients, but that alone isn't enough. Additionally, we've cultivated our network of consultants and asset owners. In equities, we received five consultant upgrades ttheir quarter, two for select long/short in addition to global core, Eurozone equity and global sustainable. Additionally, we've been -- we have seen tthey substantial increase in client requests related to ESG, including an increase in RFPs for our ESG-focused portfolios for purpose. We now manage nearly $15 billion in ttheyse strategies with AUM up 50% year-to-date. Four of ttheyse funds were named as finalists by Investment Week in ttheyir 2020 Sustainable & ESG Investment Awards, including Sustainable Global Ttheymatic, responsible U.S. equities, Green Managed Volatility Equities and Sustainable Ttheymatic Global Credit. We're also pleased to have recently launctheyd a commercial real estate debt business in Europe, including a planned sizable commitment from our partner Equitable. Ttheir is part of our stated strategy to expand our Institutional alternatives platform to new markets, while leveraging our strong relationship with Equitable as ttheyy seek yield-enhancing investment alternatives. Moving to Private Wealth Management on slide 11. Gross sales of $3.5 billion increased by 52% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially. Redemptions improved as outflows stabilized. We generated net inflows of $300 million in tthey quarter. Clients still remain relatively risk adverse though it was hardening to see some signs of growing in business transactions that are a precursor to client funding. Our focused client engagement efforts continue to emphasize virtual events and we're seeing traction on online client engagement with unique downloads up 88% across our Bernstein Insights Network. Tthey Muni Impact Portfolios continues to grow. Now $950 million in AUM, while ESG strategies have grown to $3.7 billion. Our proprietary separately managed equity loss harvesting portfolio continues to scale with AUM up 34% ttheir quarter. I'll finish our business overview with tthey sell side on slide 12. Bernstein Research experienced slowing Institutional trading volumes ttheir quarter with revenues down 3% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. A significant share of year-over-year U.S. market volume growth was due to higtheyr Retail trading which Bernstein does not participate in. We were pleased that our Asian business including India continues to post strong growth, validating our earlier investments. Our European Strategic Decisions conference had over 100 CEOs and senior executives' virtually presenting and 1,250 Institutional investors from well over 400 buy-side firms. We initiated on four sectors ttheir quarter and publittheyyd an integrated ESG research report across 50 global sectors leveraging our bottoms-up sector expertise to identify critical ESG issues for tthey stocks. We also experienced strong flow and leadership of pre-IPO research enabled by our conflict-free research platform. Highlights of some of our third quarter accomplishments are shown on slide 13. 67% of our equity assets are outperforming over three years, including 11 top quartile funds across multiple styles, capitalization and geographic categories. Our differentiated return streams continue to resonate with clients as we drove net inflows across all three client channels in tthey quarter. Ttheir is led by active equity growth across Retail and Institutional which grew organically by 8% and 14% respectively. Our Institutional pipeline remains very strong with over 50% of tthey fee base comprised of alternatives. We continue to grow our alternatives multi and multi-asset offerings as evidenced by seeding six multi-asset strategies in 2020. Importantly, our results show strong expense management, which is benefiting our bottom line as we grew earnings and distributions by double-digits ttheir quarter. Finally, as announced earlier ttheir quarter our CFO, John Weisenseel has decided to retire from AB effective in early 2021. John has been a strong partner to me in recent years and to AB over their nine-year tenure and we're grateful for their leadership. John is currently transitioning their responsibilities to Ali Dibadj, Head of Finance and Strategy, who will assume tthey CFO role in February. Ali will walk us through tthey financials ttheir quarter. Ali Dibadj Thanks, Seth. So let's start with tthey GAAP income statement on slide 15. Third quarter GAAP net revenues of $900 million increased 3% from tthey prior year period. Operating income of $217 million increased 7% and tthey operating margin was 24.1% up 150 basis points. GAAP EPU of $0.70 compared to $0.62 in tthey third quarter of 2019 up 13%. As we've done in tthey past, we'll focus remarks from theyre on our adjusted results, which remove tthey effect of certain items that are not considered part of our core operating business. We base our distribution to unitholders upon our adjusted results, which we provide in addition to and not as a substitute for our GAAP results. Our standard GAAP reporting and reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results are in our presentation appendix press release and 10-Q. Our adjusted financial highlights are included on slide 16. While third quarter revenues of $727 million were flat year-on-year operating income of $216 million, increased by 8%; and operating margin of 29.7% increased by 220 basis points driven by strong incremental margins. We earn and will distribute to our unitholders $0.69 per unit compared to $0.63 for last year's third quarter. Lower compensation and promotion servicing expenses, primarily drove tthey improved results. Compared to ttheir year's second quarter, revenues increased by 4% due to higtheyr base fees operating income increased 11% and our margin increased 180 basis points, reflecting operating expense growth of just 1% on lower promotion servicing and G&A expenses. We delve into ttheyse items in more detail on our adjusted income statement on slide 17. Beginning with revenues. Third quarter net revenues of $727 million were flat year-on-year. Third quarter base fees increased 1% from tthey same prior year period on higtheyr average AUM partially offset by a lower portfolio fee rate. Compared to tthey third quarter of 2019 total average AUM increased 6.5%. Tthey portfolio fee rate of 38.3 basis points calculated net of distribution fees decreased 1.9 basis points year-on-year. Lower fees earned on various equity fixed income products and mix drove tthey decrease, which you may recall we first discussed last quarter. Sequentially, base fees increased by 8% from tthey second quarter, reflecting 8% higtheyr average AUM across all channels with tthey portfolio fee rates essentially flat with last quarter as we discussed. Third quarter performance fees of $7 million were down $1 million year-on-year as lower performance fees for our middle market lending and concentrated global growth strategies were partially offset by higtheyr fees from Arya our multi portfolio manager long/short strategy. Third quarter revenues of $99 million for Bernstein Research Services decreased 3% year-on-year, due to reduced client trading volumes in tthey U.S. and Europe partially offset by robust growth in Asia. Revenues decreased 13% sequentially due to lower client trading activity in tthey U.S. and Europe. Investment losses of $1 million compared to gains of $4 million in tthey prior year period and resulted from losses on our broker-dealer investment portfolio and lower seed investment gains. Ottheyr revenues decreased $11 million compared to tthey same prior year period, because of lower dividends and interest earned on our broker-dealer investments. Interest expense on tthey ottheyr hand decreased $12 million year-on-year due to lower interest paid on broker-dealer customer balances, resulting from lower interest rates. Moving to adjusted expenses now. All in, our total third quarter operating expense of $511 million, decreased 3% year-on-year due to a lower compensation ratio and lower promotion and servicing expenses. For tthey third quarter, transition costs related to our Nashville corporate theyadquarters relocation, totaled $6 million compared to estimated expense savings of $7 million resulting in a net $1 million increase in operating income. Tthey $1 million in savings is a net of $4 million compensation savings and $3 million increased occupancy costs. For tthey 2020 nine-month year-to-date period transition costs totaled $21 million compared to estimated expense savings of $20 million resulting in a net $1 million reduction in operating income. Tthey $1 million expense is a net of $8 million of increased occupancy costs and $7 million of compensation savings. Total compensation and benefit expenses decreased 1% year-on-year on lower fringe benefits ottheyr employment costs and commissions. We accrued compensation at 48% of adjusted net revenues for tthey third quarter of ttheir year versus 48.5% in both tthey second quarter and tthey prior year quarter. As we typically do at ttheir time of tthey year, we plan to revisit our comp ratio and adjust accordingly as we gain furttheyr clarity as to tthey full year's revenue, compensation requirements for our business, and tthey transition costs relating to our corporate theyadquarters relocation. If tthey current market conditions persist, we do not expect that fourth quarter comp ratio to exceed 48.0%. Third quarter promotion servicing decreased 29% versus tthey same prior year period, due to lower T&E and firm meetings resulting from continued COVID-19 travel restriction. Third quarter G&A increased 4% on year-on-year due to increased miscellaneous taxes and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. In addition, G&A included tthey write-off of one-time legal fees incurred for products, which will not be launctheyd. Excluding ttheyse one-time legal fees, G&A would have increased by less than 2% year-on-year. Third quarter operating income of $216 million increased 8% from tthey prior year as expenses declined by 3%, reflecting our continued focus on managing expenses and delivering our targeted high incremental margin. Operating income increased by 11% sequentially, due primarily to a strong increase in base fees combined with a minimal 1% increase in operating expense. Third quarter operating margin of 29.7% increased 220 basis points year-on-year and 180 basis points sequentially. You may have noticed that our third quarter adjusted EPU was $0.01 below our GAAP EPU and our adjusted operating income $1 million lower than our GAAP operating income. Ttheir primarily reflects office space lease impairments, which were recorded and reflected in GAAP financial results in previous quarters, but must be amortized over tthey remaining lease terms earned as tthey financial results.  Tthey third quarter effective tax rate for AllianceBernstein L.P. was 4.2% lower than expected, reflecting a higtheyr mix of domestic versus foreign pre-tax earnings. We anticipate that tthey 2020 full year effective tax rate will range from 5% to 5.5% based upon our current forecast of domestic versus foreign pre-tax earnings.  I'll finish with an update on our planned corporate theyadquarters relocation to Nashville. We continue to expect to begin moving employees into our new corporate theyadquarters building during tthey second quarter of next year. We currently anticipate tthey reduction in 2020 EPU due to tthey relocation to be approximately $0.01 which is less than our prior estimate of $0.02 and our $0.06 original guidance for 2020.  We continue to expect that 2020 will be our last year of EPU dilution related to our theyadquarters relocation and project a slight increase in EPU beginning in 2021 with EP accretion for each year ttheyreafter. Our estimate of ongoing annual expense savings beginning in 2025 once tthey transition period is over is unchanged and is expected to range from $75 million to $80 million per year.  With that I'll turn it back to Seth. Seth Bernstein Thank you, Ali. Turning to slide 19. You might recall last quarter, we began more directly articulating tthey reasons to invest in AllianceBernstein. We'll return to tthey slide with some frequency to test our progress on behalf of unitholders. Ttheir quarter we continue to execute along tthey following dimensions that we outlined.  Firstly, we drove 5% active annualized organic growth ex AXA outflows based on differentiated investment performance. We continued to expand our suite of higtheyr fee alternatives through our recently launctheyd European Commercial Real Estate Debt business which Equitable plans to support anottheyr example of tthey strong mutual interest in growing our yield enhancing longer-dated alternative strategies. We drove expanded margins year-over-year and sequentially with G&A up less than 2% excluding a write-off of onetime legal fees.  As a partnership, we continue to benefit from a durably low tax rate and we continue to pay 100% of our adjusted income supporting our robust distribution yield of approximately 8% in a low rate environment. We look forward to continuing to report progress along ttheyse lines in tthey future.  With that we're pleased to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Craig Siegenthaler. Please go atheyad with your question and announce your company. Craig Siegenthaler Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to start on fixed income. So just given how low rates are today and tthey depressed for net return prospects across fixed income, are you seeing a rise in fee pressure in eittheyr your bond business or in your private client business? Seth Bernstein Hi, Craig. It's Seth. Thanks for tthey question. We've been seeing pressure for a long time in tthey -- particularly tthey investment-grade institutional business. And I think we've talked about that in tthey past. That continues. Haven't seen tthey pressure in tthey private client business. And in tthey retail business ttheyre -- I mean we have seen some pressure in tthey retail business that has impacted us certainly in tthey third quarter. But I wouldn't say that anything unexpected. I think it's just tthey continuation of a trend that we've been experiencing along with tthey industry for some time. But I think your point is right. It will continue. Craig Siegenthaler And ttheyn we saw a large reset in bond yields in March and April. But despite that ttheyre's been a very strong migration into fixed income. Do you think we're at a point now wtheyre ttheir may start to stall just given how low rates are? And I know you've seen a pickup in ottheyr areas like active equity, but most of your peers have not? Seth Bernstein Look I think people are remain risk adverse. I think income continues to be tthey ttheyme that resonates with investors both institutional and even more so at least in our experience in retail and I think that continues. Ttheyre's really -- ttheyre's nowtheyre else ttheyy can go. But ultimately, I think tthey central banks are pushing people into equities. I think that is tthey net result of ttheir. And so I share your concern that ttheir could ultimately begin to reverse because tthey role of fixed income is harder to justify and define in a zero-bounded marketplace. Craig Siegenthaler Thank you, Seth. Operator Your next question will come from tthey line of Robert Lee. Robert Lee Hi. Thank you. KBW. If I could drill down a little bit into tthey retail flows if possible. Can you maybe break it down? How you're seeing kind of your APAC business in tthey quarter and what you're seeing ttheyre? I mean obviously equity flows have been good. But just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing demand-wise or expectations particularly in fixed income in Asia which has been I guess a strong point for you guys for a while. Seth Bernstein Hi, Rob. It's Seth. Equity -- I'm sorry fixed income flows in Asia have certainly in tthey third quarter slowed and we see that trend continuing. I think that really is a story of two things. One, tthey local markets have been strong particularly tthey Chinese equity market. And that I think has diverted attention. I also think that as we were just talking in tthey prior question, Craig's question that lower rates obviously yield is important and yields have been falling as tthey prices have risen.  So yes, I think both of those impacts are ttheyre. We certainly have not seen any wholesale run for tthey doors. Ttheyre's continuing interest. We still see positive flows. But it's not at tthey level we had seen earlier ttheir year or certainly last year. Robert Lee Great. And ttheyn maybe as my follow-up you probably won't be able to get through a call with quarter without asking -- someone asking about M&A. So I guess maybe I'll ask it. I could probably guess your response, but you update us with all tthey recent talk chatter about consolidation and scale kind of your viewpoints on wtheyre you see AB fitting within that? And how you -- just your thoughts on that kind of trend in AB? Ali Dibadj Sure. Hey, it's Ali. I'll take that. So, obviously, ttheyre's been a lot of activity and ttheyre's a lot of anticipated activity. I'd say three things, I guess. One is, we're very much in tthey flow of information on ttheir. You can imagine, we see a lot of things come our way. We can pitch things, et cetera. And so, we're not surprised that ttheyre might be even more activity around tthey corner and very much had a sense of what was going on in tthey past. Tthey second thing I'd say is, as we've looked at it -- as ttheyy've combined, as we look at our own theirtory and tthey industry's theirtory. We are challenged to make sense about some of tthey large acquisitions that went on. In ottheyr words, our philosophy is, if cost-cutting is tthey major vector of value creation and M&A, tthey probability that that M&A is going to work is actually quite low, right? And we've seen that over and over again and tthey market frankly has riddled with examples of that so far. So, that's our view broadly about tthey M&A that we've seen, much of tthey M&A that we've seen so far. Some of ttheym actually makes sense. But our view, Morgan Stanley event is actually quite interesting, as an example, and most recent ones. But broadly speaking what we look at for M&A, as point number three, is areas wtheyre we can surgically bring on talent, bring on teams that we can grow. Wtheyre it's not a cost-cutting story, but it's a growth story. And that's wtheyre we find we add tthey most value, given our strength of distribution and finding teams that have tthey same investment discipline, great track record, a good cultural fit is tthey best way we can serve our clients. So that's our M&A philosophy. Robert Lee Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator And your next question is from tthey line of Mike Carrier. Please go atheyad. Mike Carrier Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking tthey questions. First, I just wanted to clarify on performance. It sounds like 3Q was fairly strong in fixed income. But on tthey performance chart it seems like fixing income slipped a bit on tthey one year. I'm realizing that can be solid quarters rolling off, or I think you mentioned American Income. I'm a bit below, but just wanted to confirm that. And ttheyn more importantly flows have been favorable and tthey pipeline looks good. Just wondering if tthey weaker short-term investment performance is starting to have much of an impact on conversations or clients. You remain focused on tthey stronger three and five-year track record? Seth Bernstein Hey, Mike, it's Seth. Let me just clarify one thing. Your question is around equity flows or fixed income flows, or both? Mike Carrier It's basically both, just like tthey 3Q performance looks a little bit weaker, but it seems like overall on tthey active side, not just ttheir quarter, but you guys have still been putting up good flows. So it doesn't seem like it's having a big impact. But just more curious, if it's coming up in conversations more. Seth Bernstein It isn't yet, but that doesn't mean it won't. And we recognize that performance is tthey leading indicator or one of tthey key leading indicators on flows. So we take it seriously. I do think that clients understand that in tthey case of large cap growth, which is really what triggered I think tthey significance in tthey change on tthey equity one year, is really a story about just how narrow tthey equity markets are and you guys know that story as well as we do. It's really quite remarkable. And we just weren't as concentrated as tthey benchmark. Now that could persist for a while. It has been out ttheyre, but we've done quite well. And in tthey retracement we saw a bit in September, we gained a performance as a consequence of that. So we're watching it, but we haven't seen any adverse behavior or flows as a consequence of that yet. But it's out ttheyre. With respect to fixed income, look, I think, particularly in American income tthey uniqueness of that strategy and tthey yield that it has offered clients has been compelling. Our clients in Asia in particular know tthey team well and are familiar and comfortable with tthey risk-on, risk-off nature of markets and how ttheir portfolio performs. So it's been gaining performance since March. And we're hopeful that it will continue to gain altitude again. But, I mean, tthey performance is performance and so we watch it and it could foretell lower flows in tthey future, but it hasn't so far. But overall flows, tthey overall market has been slower. Mike Carrier Right. Okay. Makes sense. And ttheyn just given tthey favorable longer-term performance and some positive flow trends, just wanted to get an update on how you guys are thinking about your distribution positioning. And if you see some areas of opportunity, wtheyttheyr it's invest in or areas to invest in to drive additional closed event. Seth Bernstein Well, look, first and foremost, I'm glad you asked that question, is China for us. We think that we have a lot to benefit from in building a presence and we are doing that now, as I think you know, in Shanghai and we're moving forward in our process with regulators. That will start as more of an onshore money management to onshore distribution, but our hope is that that ultimately opens up into being able to bring to Chinese investors our capabilities in global investing, both fixed income and equity. I think that hands down is tthey biggest opportunity we see. And that's why we're investing so aggressively ttheyre. But beyond that we continue to want to expand our private client business and are doing so and adding at base. And we are continuing to look at what we are doing theyre in tthey United States in our Retail channel. So I think, look, it's been a continuing investment focus for us since I've been theyre. And on tthey margin, China is wtheyre our emphasis is, but we continue to add resources, albeit, slowly, in tthey U.S. and a little bit in Europe. Mike Carrier Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of John Dunn. Please go atheyad with your question. John Dunn Evercore ISI. Maybe just on tthey mechanics of tthey pipeline. Any changes to wtheyre tthey demand is coming from, or has funding times changed over tthey past year? And is it coming from existing customers, you're getting any new customers? Any color you could just give around tthey pipeline? Seth Bernstein Sure. Thank you. Look, tthey pipeline had $4.9 billion of additions in tthey third quarter. And we -- it always changes a bit. I think what is different now is, we have, with tthey passage of tthey Secure Act we're seeing considerably more interest in customized retirement and that tends to be big DC plans. And so given tthey size of those, ttheyy tend to be disproportionate, ttheyy're also lower fee. We see that. We also have seen interestingly some very large fixed income investment grade, but that also tends to be lower fee. And we've seen cash. Cash has been moving back and forth. We don't have a large cash business like some ottheyr firms, but that introduces volatility both ways to tthey pipeline. In equities, most of that is client -- I'm sorry is consultant intermediated. And ttheyrefore, in a number of cases our new clients to tthey firm and so it's continued to be a door opener for us both theyre and in Europe, and to some degree in Australia. And so that has been positive for us. And in tthey alternative space that really is institutional as well. And wtheyn it's fund raising for tthey commercial real estate debt or middle market lending, ttheyy tend to go back to ttheyir original investors or ttheyir existing investor base. But we continue to add periodically, mostly from insurers and ottheyrs, who are looking for higtheyr yielding assets. John Dunn Thank you. And ttheyn, maybe a little more on tthey European, commercial real estate business, maybe what order kind of tthey objective? Maybe what ttheir might potentially look like, over tthey next few years? And ttheyn, how does that region differ from tthey U.S.? Seth Bernstein Well, we -- we want to take advantage -- well Ali why don't you answer tthey question? Ali Dibadj Okay. No, no problem. I think we're probably going to say, roughly tthey same thing. Thanks for tthey question ttheyre. Look, we're really pleased to have launctheyd ttheir commercial real estate debt business in Europe. It's important for us for a couple of main reasons. One is it's a classic example of us being able to lift and shift our knowledge base and our capabilities. And frankly a little bit of our brand from one region to tthey ottheyr. Obviously we have a very strong U.S. commercial real estate debt business. And so launching ttheir in Europe is something that's very important to us and shows tthey ability for us to expand on those. Tthey second thing that it showed and Seth mentioned ttheir in their prepared remarks is importantly it ties in to planned commitment from Equitable, it ties very much to ttheyir strategy, publicly stated of improving ttheyir yield, improving ttheyir returns, and ttheir is a great way to do that. We think to your questions ttheir scales quite well. And we do believe that ttheyre's more opportunities like ttheir, in alts to expand geographically from what we have as a good core base in tthey U.S. John Dunn Got it. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question is from tthey line of Robert Lee. Please go atheyad with your question. Robert Lee Great. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. So I'm just curious, I mean in tthey Private Wealth business you called it out that your SMA Tax-Loss Harvesting business and arguably, something similarly maybe one of ttheyse things that tracking Morgan Stanley and tthey AB brand. So could you talk a little bit about, are ttheyre plans to kind of roll out that capability more broadly than retail? That was my question. Kate Burke Hi it's Kate Burke theyre. Look, in our Private Wealth business, I think that, what you've seen from a tax perspective much of what we do is really in that SMA form. And that is a very attractive area for us that we continue to look to leverage and building out overall tthey Private Wealth business. We certainly are looking from a product strategy standpoint, across channels and how we can leverage success in one channel to anottheyr that has been a focus of our product strategy work theyre. And so we're going to continue to look for opportunities to see if ttheyre's a way to leverage that also in tthey Retail channel. Robert Lee Great. If I could -- maybe just one more follow-up, just Seth generally, I mean you guys I think have always been more sensitive to capacity constraints and your strategies maybe relative to some peers, which long-term is a good thing. I'm just curious, I know if you have any -- I mean key strategies wtheyre you feel like you may be approaching capacity limitations over tthey coming quarters, just given good demand? Seth Bernstein It's Seth. Let me answer that. Well we obviously always are monitoring capacity in small and mid-cap space. And some of that is closer and so that would be tthey most likely stuff. In tthey larger cap areas, we do have capacity limits. We think we have sufficient room that it shouldn't be impacting us any time in tthey near future, given tthey level of flows we're having. Robert Lee Great. Thank you for taking my follow-ups. Operator Thank you. And your next question is from tthey line of Bill Katz. Bill Katz Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just some technical difficulties on my end, just in terms of tthey five consultant upgrades, are you went through that rattheyr quickly. I was just wondering if you could maybe step back and just talk about maybe tthey cumulative opportunity across tthey product lines ttheyre? Seth Bernstein Hi Bill its Seth. Yeah, I think over it quickly and maybe I should have been slower. We got two upgrades for our select long short strategy. We had an upgrade for global core, And an upgrade for our Eurozone equity, and an upgrade for our sustainable growth service. Look, I think ttheyre's significant opportunity, as we get broader support from tthey consultant community. Tthey lead time on that is very hard to -- yes. It's wtheyn ttheyy have demand and start refocusing on those spaces. And so it tends to be episodic. So for example, we've seen a lot of interest for our global core strategy and now lot of that was a consultant sponsored. And it's -- ttheyy utilize a sustainable lens and to evaluate tthey companies ttheyy invest in. And ttheyy had a lot of appeal to institutions particularly outside tthey United States, wtheyre ESG is a more important focus. We think that's adaptable in tthey United States well. So we do see it as an important door opener for us. But I think we would be foolish to try and handicap it. And estimate what tthey impacts are not that you were asking so specifically for it. Because it's very much on ttheyir timeframe and ttheyir priorities, that we -- and we benefit from it. Bill Katz Great. Okay. And just maybe a follow-up for Ali and thanks for taking my questions ttheir morning, you gave some fourth quarter guidance for tthey comp. Just sort of quick recollection, that ratio seems to be a little bit higtheyr than what maybe was in tthey past couple of years of ttheir -- for tthey fourth quarter. What would be some of tthey sort of tthey variables for your thinking in terms of what might be a range within that, no more than 48%? How to think about what some of tthey key drivers might be? Ali Dibadj So, thanks for tthey question. I guess, in an absolute term 48% isn't higtheyr than what we delivered in tthey past, in tthey fourth quarter at least from wtheyre we started tthey year. Remember, wtheyn we started ttheir year we took down tthey comp ratio by a full point. So we started at a much lower level than we have done in tthey past. And we as you've seen have done our best to ratctheyt that down over time by being just more efficient across tthey board, so that's just a little bit more context to that question. For tthey fourth quarter specifically, but tthey big variable is going to view tthey markets. If tthey market is wtheyre we are today we don't think will go above 48%. But frankly your magic eight ball is probably as good as my magic eight ball about what could happen over tthey next couple of quarters. And so we just want to be very prudent in that to make sure that we are appropriately careful about tthey comp ratio and making sure we provide for our talent at tthey firm in tthey context of what's probably going to be a volatile market. Bill Katz Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from tthey line of Alex Blostein. Go atheyad with your question. Alex Blostein Great, good morning. Thanks. Hey guys I was hoping you could expand a little bit on some of tthey recent commentary you made with respect to your relationship with Equitable. Ttheyy obviously have a stated policy with trying to improve ttheyir yield on tthey assets just like many ottheyr insurance companies I guess. But can you talk a little bit about what strategies that you provide fit well within that? What are sort of tthey fee rates and opportunity set you see that for yourself? And I guess lastly, is ttheyre a bigger almost kind of like investment management agreement dynamic that you guys could work out with Equitable at some point of time like we've seen with ottheyr sort of like insurance and asset management partnerships? Thanks. Seth Bernstein Alex, thanks for tthey question. Look we've been building our private alternatives business hand-in-hand with AXA initially and now Equitable. And we focus with our middle market lending business with our commercial real estate debt business. We will do tthey same with our European commercial real estate business. And we're continuing to look for ottheyr interesting areas within private credit to build with tthey sponsorship of Equitable although ttheyy have to separately evaluate it and review its appropriateness for ttheyir general account. But we work very closely strategically with ttheym in planning out that agenda and we have an understanding with ttheym about our process and timing and tthey ultimate amount of money that we may need for ttheym to deploy and support theylping us build out those additional capabilities. We think actually tthey partnership as it's currently configured with Equitable is tthey way it should work because of tthey lines tthey interest of tthey policyholders and Equitable and AB's shareholders and unitholders respectively. In that ultimately Equitable benefits from tthey improvement in earnings we get from what are clearly higtheyr feed products and growth of those new businesses through ttheyir 60-plus -- 65% holding of AB units -- AB's ownership. So we think that alignment is pretty natural. And I think tthey coordination between tthey firms is quite strong and quite interactive. So we think it's an important plank in our growth strategy. Operator Your next question is from tthey line of Dan Fannon. Please go atheyad with your question. Dan Fannon Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on tthey fee rate and kind of tthey outlook ttheyre, retail seems to be tthey soft point in tthey quarter. Can you talk about tthey mix and kind of what are some of tthey factors are behind that? And how we should think about tthey fee rate I guess in tthey overall context going forward? Ali Dibadj Sure. Thanks Dan. So let's talk about tthey fee rate and just aggregate it a little bit to give you some extra color. So look on a year-on-year basis it was down 190 so 1.9 basis points. Lots of moving parts obviously. But essentially that change is tthey same change as we saw last quarter on a year-on-year basis. Tthey idea some of tthey issues and some of what's moving around is effectively tthey same. Broadly speaking just to remind you tthey value equities portion of our AUM was lower last quarter year-on-year ttheir quarter year-on-year. And that is a very high fee product right? So that's a mix effect. That actually happened pretty meaningfully in tthey private wealth channel that shift around and value equities happen ttheyre as well. But you're right I mean more broadly we are seeing some pressure as Seth mentioned in their prepared remarks and answered to earlier question on fixed income and some of that is in tthey Retail channel as well. But net-net on a year-on-year basis broadly tthey same ttheymes that we saw last quarter we talked about last quarter. And that leads to I guess tthey second point which is on a quarter-on-quarter basis we're essentially flat right? So essentially flat. We're seeing some fee pressure across tthey board Institutional Retail, but nothing remarkable I'd say relative to some of tthey stuff that we talked about last quarter. Tthey one thing though from a going forward perspective that it's worth emphasizing to your question about what we'd anticipate. And Seth mentioned just a little bit, but it's just worth underlining is if you look at tthey pipeline, tthey pipeline specially on tthey Institutional side has a very broad dispersion right now of fee rates in it, right? So yes alternatives, yes active equity is tthey majority of it tthey largest piece of it. But you'll see ttheir and you saw ttheir in some of our monthly AUM announcements that we're getting lifetime income strategy and CRS mandates. We're getting some of ttheyse mandates that are really chunky so really big mandates. We disclosed tthey $2.6 billion one that we talked about before. And those just by nature of what ttheyy are much lower fee rates. So tthey dispersion within tthey pipeline is quite big. What that means is although tthey fee rate will be grinding higtheyr, right? It may not be linearly grinding higtheyr, right? As something fun that's a lower fee rate and it happens to be an x billion dollar mandate you might have quarter-to-quarter volatility in that fee rate. But tthey ttheysis is exactly tthey same as it's been. And we're fortunate to have some of ttheyse larger mandates come in. Ttheyy happen to be lower fee rate. But again, it's tthey same ttheysis as before grinding slightly higtheyr over time, but could be a little bit more volatile quarter-to-quarter. Dan Fannon Thank you. That's theylpful. And, I guess, just thinking about spending for next year it's early. I'm sure you're still in tthey budgeting process, but just trying to get a sense of kind of what you're thinking about kind of return to normalization for certain discretionary items and how we should be thinking about kind of 2021 expense trajectories for some of those line items? Ali Dibadj So you're right, we're going through that process right now. If you look for example, at some of our expenses and disaggregate ttheym, right? Comp and Ben as you know we're pretty focused on that and some of tthey theylp that Nashville is going to give us -- will certainly flow into that we hope going forward. But if you look at for example promotion and servicing and G&A, right? So promo and servicing, obviously, was tthey big in ttheir quarter and you've seen so far as tthey past couple of quarters a drop for tthey year. Tthey big driver of that is certainly T&E, which is down a lot right? So you can imagine -- think about your own travel sctheydule, think about our own travel sctheydule and a lot of travel going on, right? So our hope for everybody's sake broadly for tthey world that that gets back to a little bit more of a normalized level. We are, however, looking for opportunities to not go back necessarily to tthey same level as we were say in 2019 as a whole. We're trying to really think through what tthey opportunities are. For instance, we have conferences that are much more virtual now. I'm sure you all do as well. And is that something that we can do with more permanency. To be clear, we don't expect things in T&E to be down as much as ttheyy were ttheir year, next year, but we're being very, very careful in not trying to go back to like tthey past normal because it might not be tthey past normal going forward. All that to say, we'll wait and see and we'll see what tthey clients want and adjust accordingly, but our hope is ttheyre'll be some savings right and learnings from what's happened ttheir year on tthey promo and servicing area. On G&A tthey guidance is tthey same, right? We always try to keep that in line with inflation hopefully a little bit slightly below. And again, you've seen it go up 4% quarter-on-quarter for ttheir quarter. Remember that if you exclude some of ttheyse onetime charge-offs it's less than 2% of growth, which is very much within tthey bound that we want G&A to go at. So hopefully it gives you a little bit more color as we think about it going forward. Dan Fannon Sure. Thank you. Operator And ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. I'll now hand tthey call back to Mr. Griffin for any closing remarks. Mark Griffin Thank you, everyone for participating in our conference call today.
