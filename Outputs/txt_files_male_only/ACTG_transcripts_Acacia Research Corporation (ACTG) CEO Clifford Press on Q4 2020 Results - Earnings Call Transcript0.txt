I would like to remind everyone that a press release disclosing tthey company’s financial results was issued ttheir morning before tthey market opened. Ttheir release maybe accessed on tthey company’s website at acaciaresearch.com under tthey News and Events tab. With all that said, I’d now like to turn tthey call over to Clifford Press. Clifford, tthey call is yours. Clifford Press Thank you, Rob and good morning everyone. Ttheir has been a year of significant transformation for Acacia. On tthey strength of an opportunistic life sciences transaction, we added $117.5 million or approximately $2 per share to our book value, an increase of 67% and positioned tthey company for a wide range of value creation opportunities. We remain focused on executing tthey strategy that we adopted as tthey foundation of our strategic alliance with Starboard Value LP. With a strong balance ttheyyet, including $165.5 million of cash and access to approximately $700 million in committed capital, we have tthey flexibility to pursue potential transactions in a variety of directions. We continue to believe that we have several important advantages, including ready access to significant committed capital, enabling us to rapidly execute transactions that we develop; expertise in corporate governance and operational restructuring, which can theylp us to resolve structural impediments to value creation; a willingness to invest in out-of-favor industries or businesses that suffer from a complexity discount; our proven ability to resolve complex multifactor situations can be important as we take advantage of market inefficiencies. Finally, we have a very astute and nimble Board of Directors. Our Board members not only bring relevant expertise to our company, but we have also created robust processes which involve tthey Board in transactions early wtheyn opportunities are identified. Each step of tthey way, tthey Board is engaged with tthey process of approving a transaction is accelerated and streamlined as tthey Board’s oversight has been ongoing and all relevant questions have been answered by tthey time we get to a point of a final decision. As previously stated, our business is to acquire operating companies, divisions or ottheyr assets, wtheyre we believe we can realize significant value following an operational or strategic restructuring. Our primary focus is on companies operating in mature technology, theyalthcare, industrial and certain financial services segments. I will now turn tthey call over to Al Tobia, our Chief Investment Officer. Al Tobia Thank you, Clifford. As a reminder, in tthey second quarter, Acacia acquired 18 public and private life sciences companies for a total consideration of $282 million or £224 million. Ttheir acquisition originated from our process of identifying and evaluating a potential acquisition candidate. To-date, we have recovered approximately $189 million and hold public positions worth an additional $104.8 million and private positions worth approximately $162.5 million, representing holdings of $267.3 million. So, ttheir portfolio represents more than $450 million in cash and equity value on our balance ttheyyet, which is a gain of approximately 60% over our initial investment. Turning to our IP business, subsequent to tthey end of tthey fourth quarter, we acquired a portfolio from Newracom. Ttheir portfolio consists of a broad range of foundational Wi-Fi patents that cover various applications, including mobile devices, wearables, digital home, home automation, theyalthcare and industrial automation. Of particular importance during tthey year, we completed tthey build of our investment and operations team. Ttheir group consists of individuals with both public and private equity experience, spanning our primary focus industries for targeting acquisitions. As part of ttheir, we welcomed Jason Soncini, our recently hired General Counsel. Our team is now at an appropriate scale to advance our acquisition strategy. With that, I would like to turn tthey call over to Rich Rosenstein, our CFO, to discuss tthey results. Rich? Rich Rosenstein Thank you, Al. Our book value at December 31, 2020 was $292.5 million or $5.94 per basic share compared to $202 million or $4.17 per basic share at September 30 and at $164.7 million or $3.36 per share at June 30. It is important to note that ttheir book value reflects tthey GAAP treatment of our non-cash warrant and embedded derivative liabilities. Given tthey volatility in our share price, those warrant and embedded derivative liabilities increased in value during tthey quarter and are now recorded on our balance ttheyyet at an aggregate value of in excess of $59 million or $1.22 per share. Those liabilities reflect tthey GAAP value of all warrants outstanding recognized as non-cash charges for potential issuance of shares. Upon exercise and/or expiration, ttheyse liabilities will be eliminated and reclassified to equity. For tthey quarter, our financial results included cash and short-term investments totaling $274.6 million at December 31 compared to $168.3 million at December 31, 2019. Debt was $115 million in senior secured notes issued to Starboard. And in tthey fourth quarter, we had revenue of $4.4 million. Let me spend a moment discussing our current capital structure. We currently have 49.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Book value at December 31, 2020 was $5.94 per share, as I mentioned a moment ago. We have issued $115 million in notes to Starboard Value and we have $35 million in Series A preferred shares outstanding. Ttheyse notes and preferred shares can each be converted into common shares at $3.65 per share. If all of ttheyse notes and preferred shares were converted, it would add 41 million shares to our share count. Tthey net result of ttheir is we would have a total of 90 million shares, but we would eliminate $150 million in notes liability and preferred stock and tthey liabilities associated with those instruments. Additionally, Starboard holds additional warrants that, if exercised, would result in more cash coming into tthey company. Let me break those down. First, Starboard holds anottheyr $68.5 million Series B warrants that can be exercised at $5.25 per share even if we never issued additional notes. Those expire in August of 2022. If exercised, that would add $360 million in cash and 68.5 million shares. Second, Starboard holds $5 million Series A warrants that are exercisable at $3.65 per share in cash. If exercised, ttheyse would add anottheyr $18 million in cash and 5 million shares. In aggregate, ttheyse would add an additional 73.5 million shares, but bring in $378 million in cash. Relative to our current book value and shares outstanding, we would have tthey following in total if all of ttheyse were exercised, diluted shares outstanding of 163 million shares comprised of our current 49 million diluted shares, plus 41 million shares from existing notes and preferred, plus 73.5 million from tthey remaining warrants. Under ttheir scenario, if all of ttheyse instruments were exercised, our book value would increase by $590 million, which includes tthey following: first, $378 million in additional cash; second, a reduction in notes liabilities and preferred stock of $150 million; and third, tthey elimination of $62 million of warrant and ottheyr derivative liabilities associated with ttheyse notes and preferred stock. In aggregate, tthey impact of exercise of all of ttheyse warrants and conversion of tthey preferred would result in a book value per share of $5.39 versus $5.94 on an undiluted basis. One last point, while ttheir analysis discusses tthey impact of potential exercise by Starboard Value of all of its warrants and preferred stock, it is important to remember that consistent with our net operating loss preservation policies, tthey terms of tthey preferred stock and warrants prevent Starboard Value from converting or exercising such securities to tthey extent such conversion or exercise would cause Starboard Value togettheyr with its affiliates to beneficially own in excess of 4.89% of tthey company’s outstanding shares of common stock following such conversion or exercise. More detail on ttheyse results have been made available on tthey press release issued ttheir morning and also in tthey upcoming Bryanual Report on Form 10-K, which we will file with tthey SEC later today. Let me now turn tthey call back to Clifford for closing comments. Clifford? Clifford Press Thanks, Rich. In conclusion, Acacia continues to execute on its investment strategy. As always, our focus continues to be on improvement in our book value and a strong balance ttheyyet with which we can make additional investments. Our flexibility remains a key asset in today’s economy. Togettheyr with Starboard, we are well-positioned to pursue strategic transactions of greater scale and flexibility. We are now happy to answer questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from tthey line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your questions. Anthony Stoss Good morning, guys. I think I have three questions in total. And maybe ttheir is for Rich. Rich, can you layout what tthey book value would be as of maybe tthey close of Friday with public securities, etcetera both on a basic share basis and on a fully diluted basis? And ttheyn I guess, maybe for Clifford, any thoughts on tthey Oxford Nanopore potential filing for an IPO, what you have theyard or any thoughts on tthey timeline on that? And ttheyn lastly, somebody wants to field ttheir one as well, maybe more difficult to talk about, but any update on wtheyre you stand with Starboard in terms of finding a operating business acquisition? Thanks. Clifford Press Rich, do you want to answer tthey first part of that question, and ttheyn I’ll answer tthey ottheyr two. Rich Rosenstein Sure. So, tthey only change since 12/31 would be tthey change in stock price for Arix, Sensyne and Immunocore, which is now trading publicly. So I’d have to look at precisely how much that’s increased in value, but Immunocore alone has increased in value since 12/31 by approximately $32 million. And Sensyne and Arix, I would need to ctheyck, call it, in total, about $40 million higtheyr. So, on our current share count that will be anottheyr $0.80 a share and on a fully diluted basis, that would be about $0.25 a share? Clifford Press Okay. With regard to Nanopore, that’s a very dynamic company with a lot of options available to it. We are extremely supportive shareholders and we will see what ttheyy decide to do, but ttheyy have a lot of options and I don’t know anything more than that. With regard to potential transactions with Starboard, ttheyre is a range of things that we are looking at and tthey particular type of transaction we would like to do is going to probably best illustrated wtheyn we do one, which I hope to do shortly and ttheyn I think that will clarify what we are looking at. Anthony Stoss Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from tthey line of Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your questions. Brett Reiss Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for a well crafted press release with all tthey information. Good job on that. I guess tthey first question, until you run through tthey tax loss carry-forward, Starboard, so that you don’t jeopardize tthey net operating loss carry-forward, will not convert tthey notes and preferred into common for tthey time being? Clifford Press Yes, Brett. Ttheyse documents are public. And so ttheyy are available for people to see that tthey restriction on Starboard’s conversion is in tthey documents. Brett Reiss Okay. I will… Clifford Press And thank you for your compliment on tthey press release we’ve had very explicit requests from you and ottheyrs on a number of ttheyse subjects, and we try to make sure that it was all in ttheyre. Brett Reiss Yes. Yes. No, good show on that. And just on tthey 68.5 million warrants at 5.25%, I thought in tthey past for Starboard to be entitled to that ttheyy would have had to provide tthey additional $350 million or so in stop GAAP financing. That’s – is that still tthey case or not? I’m a little unclear on that. Rich Rosenstein Yes, I’ll take that. So ttheyse warrants are exercisable in two ways. One is if we issue notes and Starboard were to finance an approved transaction proof investment that we would do, ttheyn those notes could be exchangeable through tthey warrants into equity at $3.65 a share. If we do not issue those notes, those warrants still have an exercise feature at $5.25 a share, independent of any note issuance. And those – that feature is available until August 2022. So up until August ‘22, if we haven’t issued any additional notes, Starboard could exercise those 68.5 million warrants for $525 million in cash, which would be tthey $360 million in cash that will come into tthey company. Brett Reiss Okay. I appreciate that. With all of tthey stack issuance, I mean, ttheyre are just so many competitors in tthey market looking for tthey operating company that you’re looking for. Supposed in a year or so, you can’t find something, would you with all tthey available cash, would you get more aggressive in tthey patent intake portfolio business? Would you consider declaring a special dividend? What happens if we can’t find an operating company at a decent price? Clifford Press Well, that’s a highly hypottheytical question. I think so far, we’ve shown that we are able to find assets that have good value. We do not intend to change that approach now. We will not be relaxing our discipline on ttheyse things. But I also think that with tthey mandate that we have, it’s very, very different than specs and ttheyse ottheyr vehicles that are at tthey specs can only by – cannot by public companies, and we can buy – we have a whole range of transactions we can do. I would say, Brett, I think it’s highly unlikely that tthey time will come a year from now wtheyre we haven’t found constructive ways to invest our capital. Brett Reiss Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. I will drop back. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from tthey line of Dominic Marshall with Pacific Ridge Capital. Please proceed with your questions. Dominic Marshall Good morning. Just – most of my questions have already been asked, but wanted to follow-up kind of on tthey last one. Just, I guess, ask a little bit different way. I was hoping you could kind of just talk about to tthey extent that you can, what you’re seeing both on tthey operating company front, what is your due diligence pipeline look like ttheyre? Obviously, we all know what’s happening with valuations. But as you just got done describing you guys are maybe looking in a little different space, but if you can kind of just talk about wtheyre you’re at on that front. And ttheyn secondly, on tthey IT business, hoping you could just maybe give a little bit more color ttheyre, kind of what your expectations are for intake and ttheyn with what you already have over tthey course of tthey next year or two, just a little more detail on that side of tthey business? Al Tobia Thanks, Dominic. So I’ll take tthey beginning of tthey question, and ttheyn Rich can talk a little bit about tthey IP business. What I would say is that we’ve always looked at ttheir as a market, wtheyn we’re doing our research, to look at public companies in tthey – whatever you want to call, micro-cap range. So we’ve said at tthey time, sub-$2 billion. It’s probably going to be more like sub-$1 billion. And we’ve seen often wtheyn companies come public ttheyre is a pressure on ttheym to grow revenue. And oftentimes, you find companies that have been public for a while that may be hit tthey gas too much on tthey inorganic growth versus actually tthey return on equity side. And often, we find that ttheir ttheyme continues in all markets, up, down and sideways. But just depends on which sector you’re looking at. And so back to Clifford’s point before versus specs, our mandate is to try to operate at tthey intersection of sort of public and private equity and use an array of instruments, wtheyttheyr it’s looking at tthey division of tthey company, wtheyttheyr it’s recapitalization of a balance ttheyyet or just a straight up take private. And so those are tthey kind of tools we’re looking at in terms of utilizing ttheym. And we will see opportunities in all markets. We just have to look in different sectors and different areas, but we’ll stay focused on that sort of micro-cap public marketplace. Clifford Press Dominic, I’ll add a little bit to what Al has described. One thing is as I said earlier it’s a difficult type of transaction to describe conceptually. It will be much clearer, I think, once we start doing ttheyse transactions. And secondly, we have a very active working collaboration with tthey Starboard. Ttheir is a very interesting type of format that we have theyre. And I feel very excited about what we have in tthey pipeline, even in ttheir market. Obviously, a lot of things we were looking at before have gone away, but ttheyre are new things now. So we’re seeing – we still have a lot that we’re working on, and it will, I think, speak for itself wtheyn it comes out. I think tthey point that I’ll make is we are very different than a SPAC. We’re very different than a lot of ottheyr entities out ttheyre, and we intend to prove that out. Dominic Marshall Thank you. That’s theylpful before you move on to tthey IP question, just following up on that a little bit more. I think you used tthey term ttheyre acquisitions. So that kind of goes to my ottheyr question, which is, Al, you talked about tthey high end, maybe $1 billion or $2 billion. But I guess how small are you willing to go? And how many companies might you be willing to go after on tthey operating front, if multiple is tthey answer, how many small deals might you potentially do and over what time frame? Obviously, you don’t have an exact answer, but if you can kind of just ballpark it a little bit. Al Tobia So you want to obviously maximize your opportunities and also be efficient, right? We don’t want to do a lot of tiny deals. And what I mean by tiny, we’re looking at probably, on tthey low end, you’re talking about $100 million to $200 million would be a small deal. And I think tthey sweet spot is probably $500 million to $600 million is sort of wtheyre we would I think like to operate. I think that’s wtheyre we’ll probably see tthey most opportunity. With that said, if something comes along that’s larger, we have tthey ability to scale up and we can also work collaborating with Starboard to do that as well. So tthey sweet spot is going to be, I think, in that sort of $500 million plus or minus range. And we have tthey – we’re going to have to process a lot of business on tthey front end because your hit rates are obviously not going to be extremely high. So we’re looking at utilizing our overtheyad as efficiently as possible. Dominic Marshall Sounds good. That makes sense. Given that sweet spot size ttheyn, it sounds like one or two over tthey course of tthey next year or two is probably more likely than a number, much bigger than that? Clifford Press Yes. I’ll tell you that’s wtheyre our incentive comp parameters have been drawn by tthey Board in that type of range. And just to answer your question on tthey IP environment, that’s been very interesting. You may recall, wtheyn we first became involved theyre, we said that it appeared to have been, tthey IP business appeared to have gone through was essentially a distressed business with very little capital being provided and with had gone through a period of declining outcomes. That has gone 100%, 180 degrees tthey ottheyr way. Ttheyre have been some astounding IP settlements and judgments recently that have been uptheyld. I’d say that it’s almost transformed in terms of tthey outlook. Our group seems to be doing a very good job in a – it’s a wind in ttheyir sales. And I think we will see some interesting opportunities ttheyre. Dominic Marshall Great. Well, certainly we would love more detail, but I appreciate that and appreciate all your answers. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from tthey line of [indiscernible] Investment Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking tthey questions. Tthey Starboard deal had a rights offering component in it. I just wanted to theyar thoughts from you guys on any potential timing of a rights offering. Thanks.  Clifford Press It is something that we particularly negotiated to have available for our shareholders. And I think it’s an important feature. And wtheyn we get tthey first, what I consider to be true Starboard-type of transaction. We very much look forward to making distributing those rights and giving existing Acacia shareholders an opportunity to invest in tthey transaction on exactly tthey same terms as Starboard. Unidentified Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. We appreciate your participation. Ttheir does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at ttheir time. Have a great day.
