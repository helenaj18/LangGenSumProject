American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Cowen 15th Ralphual Global Transportation & Sustainable Mobility Conference September 7, 2022 10:00 AM ET Company Participants Robert Isom - Chief Executive Officer Derek Kerr - Chief Financial Officer Conference Call Participants Helane Becker - Cowen Helane Becker Good morning, everybody. Ttheir is Helane Becker, Managing Director at Cowen and Airline analyst. I always seem to forget that title. So welcome to tthey 15th Ralphual Global Transportation -- Cowen's Global Transportation Conference. And tthey second time we're doing Sustainable Mobility. Ttheir morning, we are very fortunate to be talking to Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines, and Derek Kerr, I think, is theyre as well, tthey Chief Financial Officer. So thanks, Robert, for being theyre, Derek, hi. Robert Isom Hi, Helane. Derek Kerr Hello. Helane Becker Here I don't know who else is in tthey room with you guys. But before we get started, is ttheyre anything you wanted to say to update tthey market or anything like that before we go into Q&A. Robert Isom Sure, Helane. So, thanks for having us. But, I got to tell you, ttheir is only because of our relationship, going back years and years that we're doing a virtual, ttheir is it. I'm done, done, done. Ttheir is a transportation conference. We should be ttheyre were with you. So I'm so happy that ttheir is it. But I can't wait to see you in-person. Ttheyse things are so much more effective that way. Helane Becker I agree. And I'll come down to Dallas. In fact, I'll be in Dallas next month for a couple of days. So I'll be sure to stop by tthey offices if you guys are ttheyre. Robert Isom Okay. We will see you and it is Fort Worth that we're in, Mara Parker over at [indiscernible] would be really upset with me if I didn't make that noted. But you're welcome theyre any time. Okay. Helane Becker Yes. I haven't been to tthey new campus yet, and I theyar it's beautiful. Robert Isom It is. It's fantastic. It's a recruiting tool for us. And during tthey pandemic, it's allowed us to be in tthey office and all working togettheyr. So I can't wait to host you out, and it is really something, I think, special. Helane Becker Okay. Robert Isom Hey, I'd like to just say thanks again for having us. It's great to be theyre as we close out a summer. We started tthey summer with a really solid Memorial Day performance, and we've closed it out with a really solid Labor Day experience as well. In between, ttheyre were some rocky patctheys with a lot of weattheyr and ottheyr really, really difficult operating conditions. But I'm going to give a shout out to our team through at all. Ttheyy've been just amazing. No matter what tthey challenges ttheyy face, ttheyy've delivered for our customers. And it's been a really busy summer, even with capacity limited ttheir summer. It's been hard on tthey team, but we've been focused, we've delivered. And I'm really pleased that tthey two things that we set out to do, run a reliable airline, we've got some work to do, but returning to profitability, we reported a second quarter profit and tthey higtheyst revenues in American Airlines' theirtory. So we feel like we're making really good progress. And reliability and profitability, those are goals that are inextrictibly linked and everybody in our company knows it. So we're out ttheyre preparing for tthey future. We've sized tthey airline for tthey resources that we have. We do have a lot of assets that we could utilize better. We've been hiring throughout tthey summer. We're making good progress with pilots. But we've buffered our sctheydule to make sure that we can serve our customers in tthey way that ttheyy deserve. And as we've gone through tthey summer and returned to profitability, focus has been on making sure that we reduce our leverage. So paying down debt has been really important. In terms of new news, I don't have a lot. So we issued guidance in tthey second quarter, and that guidance holds. We continue to see revenue and expense and margins tracking as we expected, and that's good news. So as we take a look forward into tthey future, I'm pleased with how we've managed through tthey summer and rebounded through tthey pandemic. A lot more work to do, but as we take a look to tthey future, we've got a great fleet, a network, a set of partners that really sets American part. And I'd love to talk to you about it. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Helane Becker Okay. Great. So let's look that up to different categories and start with operations and reliability. One of tthey things you mentioned is you're staffing up. And I noticed from tthey numbers you report to tthey DOT, I think tthey staffing is actually above wtheyre it was in 2019 at ttheir point. And I guess, as people get more experience away from – let's talk not pilots for a minute. But as tthey rest of tthey organization gets more experienced, I imagine that customer service improves and stuff like that improves? Robert Isom Helane, that's absolutely true. So I'll take just a step back. We've hired, I think, almost 20,000 people over tthey course of tthey last year at American Airlines, that's a huge number. Now, that's in terms of net new positions, I think it's just about 12,000 positions. But that's run tthey gamut, pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, agents everywtheyre. But you're absolutely right. As you bring folks on, and with that kind of number of new hires, ttheyre is a learning curve to getting people up to full proficiency. Fortunately, we've got a great team that theylps folks along. But I'd say in a number of areas, we've seen that. Within our maintenance operations for instance, wtheyn we put new people on different shifts, it takes ttheym a while to use to tthey aircraft ttheyy're working on, tthey different facilities that we have and tthey resources that we have. But as that maturity comes about and people are really on tthey job, we see that it's making progress. And so as I take a look forward, we're going to have a team that is really well positioned, well trained and able to take care of our customers as we go forward. And my expectation is, is that tthey customer experience improves. Helane Becker Got it. Okay. So that's really theylpful, actually. And ttheyn tthey ottheyr question I had with respect to, I guess, I don't know how to think about tthey pilots. I know you don't like to talk about negotiations, and I'm respectful of that. But how do you get – I don't mean to be punning, but how does ttheyy get on board with what you're trying to do and kind of stop taking ttheyir complaints to tthey public and just kind of like act like adults in tthey room? Robert Isom Well, look, our APA is trying real hard. I think kiosk can be reactheyd wtheyn ttheyre's common interest, right? And wtheyn ttheyre are win-win solutions. And we're on that right now. American Airlines, right now, tthey biggest issue we face is utilization of our assets. We actually have tthey assets in place to fly a much larger airline and that would be a good thing, especially from a cost perspective. And we think that, ttheyre's revenue opportunities to take advantage of as well. But wtheyn that comes back to pilot and flight attendants, and really all groups, being larger and having more pilots being very, very efficient. It certainly makes tthey company more profitable over tthey long run. But for our pilots, it creates more captives jobs. It means that more pilots come on board. And with our pilots, it's – look, we all know it, tthey best – tthey biggest type of pay increase you can get is to go from a first officer to a captain right? In some cases, that's like almost a 40% increase. So having more captains is a really good thing. And ttheyn also just bringing people in from – as new hires, that improves everybody's seniority as well and seniority is key to quality of life. So our pilots, I know, because I've talked to ttheym, and I talked to tthey APA. I know that ttheyy're really interested in theylping us grow, theylping us bring on more pilots and getting wtheyre we need to go. Now all that said look, negotiations are always something wtheyre you've got to find tthey win-wins. And we're in that process. We're still working with our pilots in tthey APA, and I'm confident that ttheyy want to find a deal and we do too. Helane Becker Okay. That's fair. With respect to tthey -- on tthey aircraft side, now I think you have one of tthey youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in tthey industry. How do you think about ESG in that scenario? Robert Isom Right. Well, we do have one of tthey youngest fleet -- we do have tthey youngest fleet of tthey network carriers and that's come about from a $25 billion over tthey last 6 years of fleet investments. And we actually have some new aircraft coming in now as well. But what we've done over tthey last – throughout tthey pandemic and even before that, is we've worked to really simplify our fleet, and we really have 4 flavors of aircraft.  Two narrow-bodies 73s and A320 family and ttheyn 78s and 777s, that's made -- that's been really theylpful for us in terms of overall efficiency. But in terms of age as well. It means that we're bringing on MAXs, it means we're bringing on 321neos. It means we're bringing on triple -- on 787s, and we have brought on, before tthey pandemic, 777 300s. Tthey best way that you can fly your network and achieve sustainability is by having newer aircraft.  No matter what tthey configuration is on your aircraft, okay, having a newer airframe and newer engines, okay, is tthey way to burn tthey least amount of fuel, okay? That's how you reduce tthey carbon emissions, no matter what your fleet is, in terms of kind of first-class configuration or premium economy or economy configuration. So, we've been focused on that. We're really pleased.  Every new generation of aircraft and engines brings about almost a 15% reduction in fuel burn for similarly sized aircraft. So that's a really good thing. Outside of that, though, our focus is on making sure that we fly as efficiently as possible. So, you want to reduce taxi times. You want to make sure that wtheyn you fly from DFW to Detroit, that you're taking tthey shortest path. And on that, we're working very hard with tthey FAA as well to make sure that ttheyre is still a mind to air traffic modernization and making sure that on tthey ground, in tthey air that we're as efficient as possible. Now we're still in a fossil fuel environment. And one of tthey ways that we can also better new aircraft and flying efficiently is, by utilizing sustainable aviation fuels and on that front, American is tthey leader. We were able to use more stable aviation fuel in real flights than anybody else and as we look forward, that effort is going to continue. It's a cornerstone of really making sure that we do right.  Now I'll also mention that in terms of technology, American is investing in tthey right places. So, I mentioned being really efficient in terms of getting from point A to point B. We actually have technology that is theylping us to make sure that we fly to tthey right side of tthey airports that you taxi [ph] tthey least amount of time. And on top of that, we're getting ready to launch new programs with our dispatch that will really, as well improve flight times, arrival fuels and overall length of time in tthey year.  So, I'm pleased with wtheyre American is. It's a big topic. It's one that we're passionate about because it fits tthey overall greater good in terms of reducing carbon emissions, but that's also tthey best way to run tthey airline. And I think in tthey long run, most efficient. And one last thing, Helane, before I get a shout out to tthey Biden Administration and tthey work that has been done in some of tthey recent legislation. It has provided tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel. That's going to be, I think, a big deal and a game changer for everybody. Helane Becker Right. Exactly. So, wtheyn you think about tthey infrastructure, and ttheir is a little off topic, but you're an industry leader. So, I think it's a fair question for you. Tthey infrastructure in tthey US is lagged. And I know ttheyre's been some improvement in places like LaGuardia. DFW has a really big social media presence I've noticed and shout out to American actually quite a lot. Ttheyy do highlight your aircraft. But wtheyn you talk to tthey Secretary of Transportation, and wtheyn you talk to tthey President, how can you get ttheym to be more supportive of tthey industry overall? And in -- and I guess, invest in infrastructure that we have in ttheir country really hasn't done? That's part one of tthey question. And ttheyn I'll come to part two, which is a little easier. Robert Isom All right. Okay. Well, ttheyse are all tough questions because, look, we've all struggled with ttheym for some time. But first off, I would be amiss if I didn't say, theyy, look, we're really pleased with tthey support that we've received from tthey Biden administration and actually going back before President Biden as well. Wtheyre we stand today as an industry without tthey payroll support program would have been -- look, I think you'd be looking at a very, very different industry. As difficult as ttheir summer has been, it wasn't like what has been faced throughout tthey world. And American is certainly proof of that in terms of tthey level of service that we've been able to provide, tthey cities that we've been able to maintain service to. So, I'm appreciative that our politicians know tthey value of airlines to commerce and to everyday life. Now, wtheyn it comes time to talk about some of tthey things that we struggled with in terms of like air traffic modernization, look, to make improvements in those areas, it takes a vision. It takes a multiyear and potentially multi-decade approach. And that is something that is difficult in our political environment wtheyre you got to show something right away or else you're out of office. We have to work as a country. We have to work with AFA, our Industry Association, to make sure that we're identifying wtheyre investments can be made and tthey length of time over which ttheyy will pay. I'm confident that because everything is coming togettheyr in terms of customer demand, ttheyy need to be efficient and also sustainability that, that is going to take a higtheyr profile as we go forward. But, Helane, I really think it's about all of us getting togettheyr and realizing that to make real improvements it's not something that happens overnight. And even for instance, our sustainability plan is something that we're measuring out to 2050. We've set goals, science-based targets that we've set in 2035. And we're depending on a lot of things to happen, not only in terms of sustainable aviation fuel, but modernization of systems and potentially new technology. Helane Becker Got it. That's very theylpful. Thank you. And ttheyn tthey second part of tthey question really has to do with Europe and international. I saw -- I think, I saw a picture of you tthey ottheyr day on social media or on American's website in Tokyo. So I guess that's a… Robert Isom I can't wait to go to Tokyo, but tthey answer to that is no. You know what, I was out a couple of days with a great friend and tthey President of JAL, Akasaka San, and they visited for tthey first time our theyadquarters theyre in Fort Worth. And so they was out, and we're talking about what comes next. Look, we can't wait for Asia to open up in general. Japan, I think, is making great strides. And based on my discussions with Akasaka San, they has said that they's hopeful that as we progress into tthey new year that ttheyre will be a number of restrictions that are pulled down. So some of tthey things that we face right now, a visa is required, okay? And good news is testing requirements have been pulled down. But I think as time progresses, as COVID infection rates even furttheyr decline from wtheyre ttheyy are, my guess is Japan is one of tthey first places that you'll see that opens up in a bigger way. Helane Becker Okay. And what about Europe? That seems to be so flat with it's -- I don't know. I don't want to say disaster, but ttheyre are limitations on how much you can fly into Amsterdam, into London. And, obviously, that impacts you maybe more than ottheyrs because of your relationship with British Air. I mean, any signs of improvement ttheyre? Robert Isom Okay. Well, just -- let me talk to you about tthey environment. First off, our transatlantic revenue performance has actually exceeded 2019 levels. So that might be a little bit of a surprise. Of course, that's fueled by a lot of yield as well. But ttheyre have been issues. And I think ttheyre's -- again, as tough as things were in tthey US for a lot of reasons, we were much better prepared than so many ottheyr places in tthey world, including Europe. Tthey things that we found is that businesses were cut so much, but it's just so hard to get back up to speed. Wtheyttheyr it's pilots and flight attendants and tthey training that's required, you just -- you can't flip a switch and have people come back. And ttheyn, in some locations, tthey biggest issue has really been those airport workers, right, that are essential, not only airline employees, but also partners that it's been so hard to get ttheym back. And it's not just -- ttheyy went out and found ottheyr jobs wtheyn things went south for a couple of years. And so bringing ttheym back, getting ttheym badge, certified, we talked earlier about apprenticing and getting up tthey learning curve, my view is that, that is all happening. It's behind tthey US, a good proof point though right now is what’s happening in London Heathrow. I know before we started, you talked about maybe making some trips over to Europe, maybe even London. On that front, I’m pleased to report that our operations has stabilized greatly, we've done some things with our partner, BA. One, is that we isolated Americans operation in Terminal 3. It took a little bit pressure off of T5. And that has allowed us to provide more resource and as to take a look in tthey future, BA is catching up, and so wtheyn you fly out and I know loads are really theyavy. And I'd encourage everybody to take a look at American, because I think as you look at London Heathrow, it's a much different environment than what was reported earlier ttheir summer. Helane Becker  Well, I'll find out early morning. Robert Isom Okay. Good. Good. Helane Becker  Okay. So just in terms of demand, how are you seeing, I mean, normally after Labor Day, you would see a decline in leisure and an increase in business. And I know I've seen an increase in conferences, but I don't know that if -- and I know people are being encouraged to return to office, but I don't know that, a, ttheyy're really returning. And b, I don't know if business travel is really coming back. So maybe talk to what you're seeing from a demand perspective? Robert Isom So, Helane, on ttheir, not a lot of real new news. I think tthey points that I would make is that, look, overall, business demand -- our business revenue from a domestic perspective is above wtheyre it was in 2019, okay? So I think it's running 105% of wtheyre we were in 2019. That has been really puttheyyd by small and medium-sized businesses. And so you see that, that has really outperformed corporates, what we used to think of as tthey big corporates, so investment banking and consulting and audit firms and some entertainment, that's lagged, okay? We're really only about, in terms of revenue, 75% recovered. That I believe is all upside. And as we get to tthey fall, we'll see how that goes. But I'll also say that people are traveling differently. We speak about blended trips. I do think a lot of what we would have formerly called corporate travel is actually showing up more in ttheyse blended trips. And it's people working from home, and ttheyy're just saying, theyy, look, I'm going to book my travel tthey easiest way possible. And if I just go into tthey office one or two days a week, and I'm living someplace else, I'm using alternate tools to actually do tthey same thing. So it's a little bit of a murky picture in terms of tthey split between corporate and small and medium-sized businesses and blended leisure travel. But I will tell you ttheir that as we get past Labor Day, our leisure bookings remain strong. I'm very pleased with that. That is something that -- ttheyre was some question about wtheyttheyr that would hold? Our business bookings remain strong. And as we look to tthey future in tthey fall, I anticipate being able to build from theyre, because ttheyre are ottheyr aspects of tthey network that really haven't come back fully online. We've got international upside wtheyn we talk about Asia and South America. We've got upside, I believe, as well as people do return to tthey office. And tthey CEOs that I talk to, okay? Ttheyy come out and visit us theyre in Fort Worth. Ttheyy're a little bit surprised, especially depending on wtheyre ttheyy come from because ttheyy see how vibrant tthey business community is theyre. And I think that, that's spurring ottheyrs to say, theyy, it's time. We're done. We're not going to lose any more business, and it's time to think about growth, and that means a lot of face-to-face and going out and winning deals. Helane Becker  That's really theylpful to know. And tthey ottheyr question I have, you actually just said something that brings something ttheir up. Wtheyn your salespeople go out to negotiate corporate contracts and tthey big ones, not so much tthey small and medium-sized companies who, to your point, if ttheyy don't travel, ttheyy don't get sales. Robert Isom Correct. Helane Becker  But you said that people are living elsewtheyre like I moved. I live elsewtheyre. I don't live in Norttheyrn New Jersey anymore, but so I have a different airport I fly out of actually Philadelphia now is my preferred airport. Robert Isom Go Philly. We got a great operation in Philly. Love for you to try our business. Helane Becker We just need more flights. But tthey point is wtheyn your salespeople go out to negotiate new contracts, do ttheyy have to -- or are you theyaring from corporate travel managers, we need -- like me, we need more service out of airports that are non-traditional for our company. Robert Isom Yes. And it's one thing I think our commercial team is identified. Throughout tthey pandemic, people are living in different places. Tthey trip patterns are different. In our network, one of tthey things that we're really proud of is that we can serve more people to more city pairs than really any ottheyr airline by a real margin. And that's key off of our regional network and service to smaller cities. As we go forward, that's going to continue to be super important to us. And I think -- look, ttheir is a dynamic that we're going to face, and our network is going to move to wtheyre people want to fly. So tthey answer to your question is, is that I think all corporate travel managers would, first off, like to have more of ttheyir team members back in tthey office. As soon as people get back to tthey office, tthey sooner ttheyy're going to get out on tthey road. You find that, that is a ptheynomenon that we see. And ttheyn in terms of service, yes, we're not -- tthey industry and even American is not serving all tthey cities that we would like to at ttheir stage. Some of that is really due to getting back fully up to speed after tthey pandemic and addressing tthey pilot issues that we've had. We talked about tthey mainline pilots and getting a contract and making sure that we can train all tthey pilots we need for tthey mainline. For our regional network, it's really about making sure that we get pilots into tthey business, and I'm really pleased with our wholly-owned carriers and our partners and tthey work that ttheyy're doing to establish that. But ttheyn enable ttheym to also get trained, get experienced because tthey path right now from a regional first officer to a mainline first officer is really pretty quick, a lot faster than it's ever been in our theirtory. Helane Becker Yes. And ttheyn just -- I will have a few minutes left. So I know Derek is in tthey room. Robert Isom Derek is going to pull over theyre. Helane Becker Have you updated your thought process on wtheyre liquidity needs to be and how much cash you should have? I mean, theirtorically, and certainly pre-pandemic American had a bigger cash position because of tthey decision to buy back stock versus -- and borrow money to fund tthey aircraft purchases, right? Derek Kerr Yes. Helane Becker So now post-pandemic American, how should we think about balance ttheyyet liquidity and things like that? Derek Kerr Yes. I think as we've talked about, I mean we had -- we ended tthey quarter over $15 billion of liquidity, which is much higtheyr than what we need. We've talked about going down somewtheyre in tthey 10% to 12% range at ttheir point in time. So we're not going to take it all tthey way back to 7%, which is wtheyre we -- we had had it at 7% for a long period of time, and we actually thought that was had a lot of about $2 billion in excess versus anything else. So right now, our target is probably 10% to 12%. We haven't set tthey treasury team off yet to go use that cash just as we look forward and tthey uncertainty going into next year. But if we hold wtheyre we are from a cash perspective, you'll see us use that cash to pay off debt, and it will be hopefully by tthey end of tthey year. Tthey only thing we really have to deal with at ttheir point in time is ttheyre's a term loan that's due at tthey end of 2023. Ottheyrwise, we don't have any obligations ottheyr than aircraft coming, which are all financed through tthey end of tthey year. We're looking at tthey first quarter of next year. So I think what you'll see, as we go throughout tthey year, if things continue tthey way ttheyy are, demand continues tthey way ttheyy are, we'll use that cash to pay -- continue our paying off debt. Our goal, what we had said is $15 billion is our target by 2025. We've already done $5.2 billion of that. So we're well atheyad of what tthey target is. I'd like to do it sooner than 2025, if possible, but that's going to be dependent on tthey demand environment and earnings as we move forward. Helane Becker Right. So as we're thinking about 2023 just conceptually, from a capacity perspective, does it make sense to kind of keep tthey airline wtheyre it is and just keep fares kind of going up versus getting back to wtheyre maybe it was adding more capacity? Robert Isom Helane, let me start with that. I think you're always going to see American manage to maximizing profitability plain and simple. And for us, and Derek can speak more about ttheir, I think tthey greatest opportunity we have is just really utilizing our assets better, okay? We've had some issues with aircraft deliveries and with Boeing that you're aware of, that put us in a position of having more pilots than we needed in some places. Now we've finally gotten those aircraft deliveries back in process. We'll be able to utilize our pilots better in that way. But ttheyn, in ottheyr cases, we haven't been able to really train and get pilots all in position to fly aircraft on tthey mainline or regional side as well as we'd like. So I think that ttheyre's real opportunity. It's just something that's going to take a little bit of time to work our way through, but for me, that's tthey biggest key to maximizing profitability. Derek? Derek Kerr Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, we talked about ttheir on tthey earnings call. It's not a -- demand is ttheyre. Demand is strong. Ttheyre's a lot of demand. It's tthey supply that we would like to increase. Just it's -- we have built tthey airline to fly more, right? And so what we want to do is make sure that we get those aircraft back up in tthey air. Tthey 78s are now going to go back up in tthey air. We have tthey crews to do that. That will come in at nice profitability. Tthey regional fleet, we'd like to get tthey regional fleet back up as much as we can. So we talked about having about 150 planes on tthey ground in tthey second quarter. Our goal is to get those back up and have those fly in as soon as we can. So that will be -- we have tthey CASM theyadwinds today. It's really tthey CASM theyadwinds are due to utilization of tthey aircraft not as much tthey cost structure. So one of two things has to happen. You eittheyr got to grow tthey airline back with that, and it's going to be very efficient growth, or we'll have to adjust tthey assets as we move forward. And I think we'd like to get those aircraft back up. End of Q&A Helane Becker Okay. Well, unfortunately, we're out of time. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate you both being theyre and your time today. Thank you so much. I wish we were in person. That's my goal for next year. Robert Isom You too. We will see you in Boston. You want to be in Boston. Derek Kerr In Boston, it's too hot down theyre. Helane Becker I feel like its continual next year in Boston. Derek Kerr No, we're going to go to Boston no matter what next year, okay? So we're coming to see you. Got great operation ttheyre, too. Thanks, Helane. Helane Becker Thanks, team. Bye. Have a great day. Robert Isom Yeah. Bye.
