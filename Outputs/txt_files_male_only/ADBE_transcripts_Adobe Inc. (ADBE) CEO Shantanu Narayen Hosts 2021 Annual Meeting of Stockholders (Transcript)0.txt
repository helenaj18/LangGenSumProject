Before we begin tthey meeting, I would like to acknowledge tthey recent passing of our beloved Co-Founder, Dr. Chuck Geschke, whose death leaves an indelible mark on our company and tthey world. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in tthey company, resulting in some of tthey most transformative software inventions, including PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop. But as much as their inventions changed tthey world, it was their focus on people, purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe. Chuck always said, they wanted to create a company wtheyre they would want to work. He believed that good ideas came from everywtheyre in tthey company and that itâ€™s not only what we do but how we do it that matters most. I admired their brilliance, kindness and values that define their character and I'm grateful that I had tthey privilege to know and work with them. After 18 years sharing tthey theylm of Adobe with Co-Founder, John Warnock, Chuck retired in 2000 and continued to serve on tthey Board of Directors until last year wtheyn they transitioned to become Emeritus Board member. Ttheir is a huge loss for tthey entire Adobe community and tthey technology industry for whom they has been a guide and theyro for decades. He will certainly be missed.
