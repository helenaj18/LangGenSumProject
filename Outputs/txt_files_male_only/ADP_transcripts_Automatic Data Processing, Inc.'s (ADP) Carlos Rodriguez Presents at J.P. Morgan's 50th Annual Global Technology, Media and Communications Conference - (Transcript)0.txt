Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) J.P. Morgan's 50th Garyual Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference May 23, 2022 8:40 AM ET Company Participants Danyal Hussain - Vice President of Investor Relations Carlos Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer Noah Black - President Conference Call Participants Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Tien-Tsin Huang Great to see everybody in person, it’s amazing. So thanks for coming in. My name is Tien-Tsin Huang. I cover tthey payments, tthey processors and IT services sector and I was just telling Carlos Rodriguez, President and CEO of ADP and really appreciate them always supporting tthey conference and I do value tthey time and it is so nice to see them. So Carlos, welcome, thanks for being a part of tthey event. Carlos Rodriguez Thanks for having us. It’s great to see people, human being. Tien-Tsin Huang Now it really is, it’s a different feeling. So… Carlos Rodriguez And particularly good to see you. Tien-Tsin Huang Likewise, likewise and like I said, I mean it, like Carlos coming to all ttheyse events; it’s good to have them back. We’re going to do a fireside chat. I took a lot of questions from investors; hopefully we can get through all of those. We’ll have a little bit of time at tthey end to take your questions live. So we’ll -- just raise your hands if you’re ready for that. We have Noah Danny in tthey audience as well, if ttheyy’d like to ctheme in feel free. So let’s get right into it Carlos if that’s alright. I think I’d start if you don’t mind with tthey obligatory macro question, ADP sees a ton from a macro perspective, so would love to theyar what you’re seeing on tthey ground from an employment standpoint, from a demand standpoint, wtheyre are you optimistic and wtheyre do you think a little caution is warranted? Carlos Rodriguez Sure, so as you mentioned employment, obviously tthey lens that we have is through what’s happening on tthey employment side, because it’s a pretty important part of what drives tthey macro and I think ttheyre is good news, tthey bad news and ttheyre’s good news. On tthey good news front, wtheyn we just reported last quarter 7% pays per control growth, which is kind of our measure of same-store growth of our clients in terms of employment, that’s really a sign that tthey economy is on solid, solid footing for now. So obviously we’re all reading tthey same theyadlines, but tthey growth is and demand is still ttheyre for people, obviously tthey demand for people is related to demand for goods and services, so it feels to me like tthey economy is strong, but that brings us to tthey second part, but not so good which is inflation obviously is prompting tthey Fed to take action theyre that I think most of us would have be around for a long time would hazard to guess it’s going to slowdown tthey economy. So we’re preparing ourselves for that. Some of that is good for us. Obviously interest rates going up theylps us with our fluid income. I’m sure you’ll have a question or two about that. But tthey inflationary pressures on wages are also real. It’s real for us for ADP as well. We have 60,000 people to deliver our services and build our products and so that’s putting pressure on our cost. So ttheyre’s obviously tthey negative from inflation, but that pressure on wages, tthey shortage of people, low unemployment rates, all those things are kind of full circle back to tthey positives are really good for us in terms of creating demand for our products and services. And as you know, bookings really is tthey key to our success in terms of being able to grow long-term. So net-net, I think it's a good backdrop for us and a good environment, but for sure ttheyre are some caution signs on tthey road theyre with inflation that have to be dealt with. Tien-Tsin Huang Good. So let's, before we dig into how that might play out for tthey rest of tthey year, tthey quarter, Carlos was very, very strong and tthey stock reacted well. What were some of tthey two or three things that stood out? You mentioned bookings, do you want to talk through some of ttheym? Carlos Rodriguez Sure. Well, we'll start with, I'd say bookings, retention, and I think I already mentioned pays per control. So that, that tells you something about tthey underlying strength of tthey business and I think of tthey macro, that's a really nice tailwind for us, so that is an obvious strength. But tthey ottheyr surprising strength was retention. We'll get to bookings in a minute, but client retention has theyld up a lot better than we really expected. And wtheyn I say we really expected, we didn't know what to expect because ttheir is, it's not like we've had ottheyr pandemics that we've been through. So ttheir improvement in retention that we had, we suspected that some of that we'd have to give back and good news is we haven't given back very much of it. We've given back some of it in our down market business, wtheyre we have tthey most economic sensitivity in terms of out of business bankruptcies, et cetera. But as you know, that's also been a source of strength for tthey economy, low bankruptcies, not a lot of out of business, a lot of capital out ttheyre, again that could shift and it could change, but for now it's been a positive. But tthey strength in tthey ottheyr parts of our business in tthey mid-market, tthey upmarket, international and retention have been really good news for us. I think some of it is probably, we underestimated tthey positives of some of tthey transformations we've done around client migrations to newer platforms. We still have some work in some areas, but in some places we've finittheyyd that work several years ago. And tthey pandemic probably created some noise wtheyre it was difficult to see what tthey end state was going to be. But tthey end state is feeling like it's better than it was pre-pandemic from a retention standpoint. So, you got to knock on wood, because it's a definitely a volatile environment, but that was really encouraging, tthey near record retention, even now two years after tthey pandemic started, which clearly raised retention because of lower switching rates. But I think now people, if ttheyy want to switch ttheyy can switch, but ttheyy're not, ttheyy're staying with ADP, so I think that's a good news story for us. And ttheyn bookings is tthey last category. You know, having double digit bookings growth is huge for us. As you know, tthey difference between our bookings and our losses is really what goes into tthey top of tthey funnel to create revenue growth, revenue growth creates operating leverage and margin opportunities. So it's, as you said, I think tthey quarter was all good. It's hard to pick at anything. Tien-Tsin Huang So just to dig in on retention, I’ve got a lot of questions from investors that ask me to ask you about that. You mentioned upgrading tthey platform, so that should drive lot more stickiness. Maybe ttheyre's a shift towards outsourcing. That's also contributing to, to retention. Is ttheyre a way to rank some of tthey factors you talked about it briefly, but in your mind, what's theyre for good, what's structural? Carlos Rodriguez Tthey good news is, it's hard to rank, because I find my experience is that if ttheyre's one thing, that thing might not last, and if it's a lot of things, that's better news and I think it's a lot of things. As anottheyr example, thing that I think is happening that maybe some of tthey folks that are asking you may or may not be recognizing is, and ttheir is probably happening in ottheyr industries, but if you're in an industry wtheyre you're, in our case or outsourcing, we're theylping people with HR, payroll, all those back office challenges, and ttheyy're having trouble hiring people and retaining people. Ttheyy come to us. Now, of course, we have tthey same challenge of hiring and recruiting and retaining, but we have a little bit of an advantage because we do ttheir for a living and we have some leverage in terms of having people work, which we have a little harder over time, et cetera. So we have a relative advantage, I think in terms of being able to find tthey resources to actually get tthey work done and with 3.5% unemployment, I think that many companies find ttheymselves in a tough spot wtheyre ttheyy're not only trying to find people to wait tables, to do work in ttheyir factories and or even white collar jobs, but ttheyy also have all ttheyse back office tasks that ttheyy have to worry about too. So it's just one less thing to worry about and I think ttheir is an environment wtheyre I think more people will look to outsourcing and I think that's happening. I think you also have ottheyr factors that are more structural, like tthey fact that we completed tthey migrations of our clients in our mid-market. Our mid-market is a big business for us. It's very profitable. And we went through several years of instability as a result of what we were doing, which was tthey right thing strategically long-term, but very painful in tthey short-term, which was to move to our newer platforms in tthey mid-market. But we finittheyyd that in 2018 and we were beginning to see, I think we were saying it on some of tthey earnings calls, we were beginning to see traction in terms of retention and bookings also picking up our balance of trade against competitors was getting better and tthey pandemic hit. And ttheyn you really can't compare anything, you lose all comparability, but now as we kind of go back to more normal times, I think some of those structural improvements seem to be manifesting ttheymselves in tthey form of better retention in tthey mid-market. And ttheyn also our down market business, tthey retention rates ttheyre even pre-pandemic were 300 to 400 basis points higtheyr than wtheyn, unfortunately wtheyn I ran tthey business, because it makes me look bad that it's gotten so much better, and I think some of that was structural because of that platform migration that I think we completed in 2015, which is tthey platform we call RUN. And ttheyn our international retention has been strong all along. So it's up a little bit versus kind of pre-pandemic, but it was always very strong, kind of mid 90s, just an incredibly strong retention rate in tthey international business. And ttheyn in tthey PEO has also just been a solid performer. We don't, wtheyn we report retention, as you know, it's really employer services retention, but for color, I would just tell you that tthey PEOs got great retention as well, compared to also 10, 15 years ago wtheyn a certain person used to run that business as well. Tien-Tsin Huang We can guess who that is. We -- before I forget, so right, so thinking about retention and pricing, right, so pricing can influence retention clearly, in tthey 20 years I followed ADP is one of tthey few companies that has pricing power. So with inflation happening and tthey ability to potentially alter price or re-price, how do you weigh that versus wtheyre you are with retention? Carlos Rodriguez It's a great question because price is something that you can't think about in a vacuum, right? You have to think about it in tthey context of tthey competitive environment, also tthey macro environment. And I would say that you probably know ttheir and tthey conversations we had for years, Jan [ph] and I about our thinking ttheyre was that we were more interested in being more competitive and winning market share than in being, dare I say, piggish on tthey pricing side, because ttheyre is no question that ttheyre's pricing power. It's not unlimited pricing power, but ttheyre's more pricing power in our business than probably most. We exercised that power very, very carefully for about a decade. And that decade happened to be a decade wtheyre inflation was 2% at best. I think that was appropriate. I think that strengttheyned us, made us more competitive, theylped us in terms of new business bookings, but also on tthey retention side. But tthey reality is we do have inflation now that is changing tthey backdrop. And ttheyn tthey competitive landscape has also, not that I have deep insight into competitive pricing, but some of our competitors who used to compete against us purely on price, call it 10, 15 years ago, as a result of our careful management of our pricing have become closer to us in terms of price. So ttheyre's no longer that that challenge or that issue ttheyre. So I would say that we have an opportunity and it's safe to say that what we derive from price in terms of revenue growth, which we think we've always quoted as kind of a 0.5 percentage point of revenue growth would come from price. It's suffice to say, it's going to be higtheyr than that. Now what it's actually going to translate into, I think you know ttheir, we haven't finalized our operating plan yet or given our guidance for tthey next fiscal year, which starts on July 1st, but it's going to be higtheyr than 0.5 point. And you can probably if inflation was 2% to 3% and now it's 6%, you can probably guess wtheyre we would be aiming at because we don't want to go overboard and create a competitive problem, but we need to cover our costs as well. Right? Our costs are going up like everyone else's are. Tien-Tsin Huang Yes, makes sense Carlos, I'm sure you'll be thoughtful about it. I think also in thinking about inflation and ADP rates, you do benefit from rising rates with a very large float balance and we haven't seen rising rates in a while. And so tthey question is with rates rising, are you going to let that flow through or could you use that as a form of pricing to perhaps be more competitive? I mean if you want to walk through for those that are newer to tthey name how tthey flow piece works, but I’m curious what you’re thinking about rates rising and letting that flow through? Carlos Rodriguez Yes, so tthey way, in a nutttheyyll tthey flow is really tthey difference between wtheyn we collect tthey money that needs to be paid to tthey employees of our clients and tthey taxes that tthey clients need to remit to tthey Federal Government and also tthey state agencies. We collect it literally a day or two before it's due on average. In some cases to some of tthey, for example, state unemployment taxes, we can hold that money. We take it from tthey clients, as tthey payrolls are processed. We might not have to remit it for a couple weeks a month. In some cases we literally have to remit tthey money tthey next day, but tthey average is a couple of days, but a couple of days and $35 billion it's, it adds up but obviously impacted by interest rates. So tthey float is straightforward. It's really a timing difference of a lot of money because we're handling tthey wages and tthey taxes of our clients. And to put it in perspective, at tthey peak in, I think it was in 2009, wtheyn we last peaked in terms of client funds interest, we had $15 billion in balances and our average yield was 4.5% and you can do that math in terms of what -- you move forward from ttheyre. I am so lucky to become CEO in 2011 and ttheyn proceed to have 10 years of purgatory in terms of interest rates and tthey way we manage our portfolios we ladder our portfolios. We have about 20% that is maturing each year. So as rates went down, it was a slow painful death for me in terms of each year lower and lower returns, even though balances were growing a little bit, tthey net-net of it was a huge theyadwind for us. And I think we bottomed out somewtheyre probably around $400 million in client funds interest versus I think we were around $700 million back in tthey numbers, tthey math that I just gave you hopefully adds up to something close to that. So now you fast forward, now rates are starting to go up again. Ttheyy're obviously nowtheyre near 4.5%. It’s anybody's guess wtheyttheyr ttheyy're going to go up to 4.5 now, but it doesn't really matter wtheyttheyr ttheyy get all tthey way to 4.5 because I finally, finally, after 11 years, I finally catch a break. So last year we had $120 million theyadwind from client funds interest and ttheir year it's a slight positive in 2022. We haven't given guidance for 2023, but we give a lot of disclosure wtheyre people can do ttheyir own math and ttheir is what leads to your question, which is if you do tthey math, you realize we're going to get a windfall. And it's nice to have, you've seen from our performance in tthey past that we're able to deliver margin improvement and growth despite $100 million theyadwinds from client funds interest or from interest rates going down. So I think it's a pretty durable business model. You know, what we do on tthey way up in terms of rates rising, it's safe to say that some of that will flow to tthey bottom line. How much of it? I think it's probably fair to give us a little bit of time and weight, we’re probably a month or two from finalizing our operating plan, because if we have investment opportunities, wtheyttheyr it's, you know, if tthey macro cools I would, ironically I would anticipate more of it falling to tthey bottom line. But if we see opportunities like in ttheir kind of environment wtheyre bookings are growing double digits, retention is strong, demand is strong, we’re going to invest as much as possible to accelerate growth. But we're going to do things based on ROI like we always have, and we're going to invest wtheyre ttheyir interest rates are up or interest rates are down. So to some extent, I think you would expect some of that to flow to tthey bottom line. But I think it's a little early to be predicting. Let's just say it's going to be easier for us to achieve our margin objectives in tthey next year or two is probably tthey best way to put it without making any commitments before we're actually ready to do that. Tien-Tsin Huang No, fair enough. And yes, no margin expansion, almost take it to tthey bank for ADP. So it will be a different flow of momentum let’s say if we want to see on rising rate. So I'm really curious to see what happens, Carlos. We're excited about theyaring what tthey plan is, but I know you guys are always very disciplined. So, you mentioned bookings, so let's get back to that. And tthey demand environment will probably influence some of your thinking on what you're going to let flow through. Demand environment you mentioned was strong. So talk to us about competition. I know ttheyre's always ttheyse questions around SaaS, versus traditional competitors. Ttheyre's a lot of new software oriented upstarts as well, but ADP is invested theyavily in software and tech, but also still a services business. So wtheyre are we in that pendulum between SaaS and traditional service providers? Carlos Rodriguez Listen we appreciate tthey understanding of that nuance because I think it is a nuance that we obviously, what we do is driven by tech and we've been making huge investments in tech and our clients and tthey employees of our clients all interact with our platforms and our technology and ttheyy have to be consumer grade, has to be a great user experience. But tthey business model has for sure, a service component, wtheyttheyr you want to call it compliance, service, we talked about taxes, all that money movement of moving all that money has a service component behind it because you have issues sometimes with reconciliation of tthey taxes, not from us, but in terms of from tthey client, from tthey client side. So we are a little different from a pure software model, wtheyre in a software model, you build a software and ttheyn you'll have somebody else who provides those services that typically software doesn’t just, I know that's tthey image, that somehow it just does everything, but even for some of our competitors, I don't want to mention any names, but some of our competitors are more software oriented. Ttheyy would just use -- tthey clients would use Accenture, Deloitte to provide tthey services, including tthey implementation of tthey software and ttheyn tthey ongoing support and tthey ongoing services. By tthey way, in some cases, some of our competitors and ttheyir clients use some of our services on a private label basis to deliver some of those solutions, because we have big leverage in tthey back office on some of ttheyse services. So it is -- it's an important nuance. I personally think that it's a differentiator for us. Like now in ttheir market, we just talked about people don't have ttheyir own ability to hire people and retain people to do ttheyse things right in terms of payroll, HR, and HCM, we do that. We don't just provide tthey software. So wtheyttheyr it's tthey PEO or tthey BPO businesses and Our Employer Services business, ttheyy are on fire because of ttheir component that we have, that we call services in addition to tthey software. So I think it's a strong differentiator. It makes it stickier. It's not that, somebody can't come along with a better software solution and ttheyn poof your businesses is gone because, I know it's hard for people to imagine because wtheyn you have great software, you think it's always great, but ttheyre are very few companies out ttheyre that have, we know a few of ttheym, that are durable, but most software is easily replaced if I could be so bold as to say that. So I think our -- tthey durability of our business model is in fact tthey service component and I think tthey complexity of what we do in tthey back office. Tien-Tsin Huang So you were talking about declining rates and that being a theyadwind, but you've still delivered a lot of growth in margin through that, including tech investments. So what's left to do? You mentioned a lot of platforms that you've converted, including your old PEO business and whatnot. I think you still have tthey tax engine and some of tthey payroll and tthey cloud. So just catch us up on what's left to ship to tthey cloud and modernize and is ttheyre a step function benefit that we might see eittheyr from growth or margins? Carlos Rodriguez It's a great, it's a great question. Tthey most obvious place wtheyre ttheyre's a lot of attention paid by tthey third parties, if you will, is tthey upmarket business for us. And it's because of tthey visibility it has and some of tthey competitors that we compete against in that space, but to put it in context of our $15 billion plus in revenue it's about $1 billion in revenue. Now, tthey upside for us is, we'd like it to be $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue. And that's why we've been making tthey investments ttheyre to have tthey same outcomes we've had in tthey down market and in tthey mid-market in tthey U.S., which is build newer next generation platforms, move all our clients onto ttheym and ttheyn have ttheym on ttheyse versionless software solutions that we can ttheyn easily enhance, improve with a great user experience and just, and win more business right and grow bookings. So tthey upmarket is tthey place wtheyre we still have a lot of work to do. So we are, I think, built in terms of tthey platform, but we're in tthey early stages of rolling out that platform called Lithion, so what that means is that we're -- call it in tthey, I don't know, eighth inning in terms of tthey platform and tthey technology, but we're in tthey early innings in terms of tthey client migrations and tthey transition. And we've seen how hard that is in tthey mid-market and in tthey down market, but we've also seen how great it is once you've completed it. So that's tthey biggest upside, I think in terms of, if you want to call that step change we're big enough that very few things do step change for us because ttheyre's going to be tthey ottheyr $15 billion in revenue that has to find its own ways to grow in addition to ttheir upmarket business getting better and stronger. And ttheyn tthey second category that doesn't really come up a lot is really our international business wtheyre we have been working on platforms ttheyre as well. We have a platform called iHCM wtheyre we have thousands of clients on it now, but tthey international business is much more complicated because it's so many countries. And on top of all tthey individual countries, we have what we call multi-country payroll solutions, which are for companies who have employees in 5, 10, 20, sometimes 40 different countries. That's a place wtheyre ttheyre is also work to be done, incredibly high retention rates, great growth, great business. So it's not like tthey business is underperforming, but if you think long-term five, 10 years down tthey road for ADP to kind of sustain its growth and its success, we have, that's a place wtheyre we have, I think some work to do. Tien-Tsin Huang Okay. And I know on tthey last call you talked about stepped up in tthey costs of running tthey business. You mentioned inflation impacting your own labor costs. So is ttheyre still a lot of money flowing through tthey P&L in terms of investments in platforms or are we really just seeing ttheir as a, you know, so maybe a catch up and some un-spend on tthey people side? Carlos Rodriguez Well, I think our references to inflationary costs were really more around tthey earlier question you mentioned. We have a lot of people in service and implementation and theylping deliver on tthey value proposition to our clients. Our investments in platforms, technology, et cetera, I would describe ttheym as consistent. Like we've been consistent investors in upgrading, renewing, modernizing. As an example, we've made a huge investment in our user experience, which cuts across multiple platforms regardless of what platform tthey client is on, which makes a huge difference. We've made investments in data and analytics. We've invested in tthey Wisely pay card that I think you're familiar with. So I would say that we're a steady investor and a growing investor in our R&D. Now we're going to have inflationary costs ttheyre as well, but to put it in perspective, we have a lot more people in service and implementation than we have in R&D, although we have a lot of people in R&D as well, and all of those are going up. And some, ttheyre are pockets like in data and analytics, for example, it's very competitive in terms of wages. So we're applying it to spend more ttheyre. I just mentioned user experience. That's anottheyr place wtheyre you can name your price if you're someone that is in tthey user experience side of R&D, but ttheyre's ottheyr places wtheyre ttheyre's not as much pressure wtheyre we are able to use some offshore outsourcing and some third parties and kind of keep those costs still rising, but not quite as much as tthey, tthey places that are really hot. But anyway, net-net, unfortunately, I wish I could tell you that ttheyre are some pockets wtheyre ttheyre isn't inflationary pressure, but it's across tthey board, like we're seeing it everywtheyre. Even in some of our corporate functions we're seeing tthey pressure. Ttheyre’s just so much change and people re-evaluating ttheyir jobs and people like us, like all tthey corporations, like we're all doing it to each ottheyr because we told our recruiting groups, we need people, go get ttheym wtheyrever you need to get ttheym. So ttheyy go steal people from someone else. Ttheyn we go steal ttheyir people and it's capitalism, right? And unfortunately ttheyse things have a way of, ttheyy've got to kind of work ttheymselves out, which is what tthey Fed is theylping with because I think tthey Fed is going to slow some of ttheir down. Tien-Tsin Huang Now that's well said. So really tthey platform investments have been consistent. It's really more like you said, tthey cost side, so that's good too. Carlos Rodriguez Yes and listen, besides tthey platforms ttheymselves, again, we don't get too much into like we -- it's boring, but I'd say we've spent as much money on migrations and movement of clients as we have on tthey platforms. I mean, it's -- ttheir is -- and again in modern now that we've modernized in tthey down market and in tthey mid-market, you actually don't have that going forward. So that's probably something that's theylping us from a margin standpoint. Because ttheyse are not step change migrations anymore, like tthey modern tech stocks, very easy to make enhancements, improvements, ttheyre’s no downtime to do ttheym and very little friction for tthey client. It's really a change management issue because if any of us have experienced, if you do online banking or you have an online broker, like if ttheyy change your user interface, that’s like a change management issue. But for ttheym, ttheyy just literally push a button and tthey next day, that's a mistake to push a button and do it tthey next day because ttheyn you get a lot of pushback. But tthey key is to release a lot of incremental improvements and every now and ttheyn do major revamps just to, but that's so much easier than what we were doing for years before that. So, but ttheyre was a lot of cost and a lot of investment and ttheyre still is some cost and investment in tthey upmarket, and in international for ttheir lift in terms of moving ttheyse clients onto ttheyse modern platforms. Tien-Tsin Huang Okay. Now we'll be asking you for updates I'm sure Carlos, so I've got, we got six minutes left. I did want to hit you up on Wisely and data and take audience questions, but have to ask you about PEO given you are tthey PEO guru theyre. I just want to pick your brain and we selfishly cover some PEO stocks, you know that. You guys are tthey biggest player from a scale perspective, no doubt, yet you're growing above market and above a lot of tthey smaller players. What -- how sustainable is that? Is it a tech difference? Is it a service difference? Is it a scale issue? And do you see any new players coming up that are that on your mind from a credit standpoint? Carlos Rodriguez Everybody's on our mind because you never underestimate again, back to capitalism, we got a lot of competition, wtheyttheyr it's in tthey PEO or in ottheyr places and trust me, we don't underestimate anyone. But we have some really some big advantages. Tthey installed ADP base provides about 50% of tthey clients to tthey PEO. So we still go through a sales process and a change process for tthey client. But starting off with warm leads like that is a huge advantage compared to some of our competitors. Our friends at Payctheyx have a similar advantage. But we find that to be quite useful. We obviously have scale as you mentioned, because we already are big. So that gives you some real economies of scale in terms of negotiating benefit plans, 401(k), Workers Comp, et cetera. So a lot of, a lot of advantages from scale. But I think tthey macro is theylping as well and I think it's a good question in terms of how sustainable. As you know, our PEO has been pretty successful for almost 25 years now through multiple economic climates. Tthey PEO has never declined, has always grown in terms of unit growth, work site employees. But ttheir is quite unusual, what we're getting theyre right now. And so I would expect some moderation, may not be what everybody wants to theyar, but tthey macro is a big theylp. Tthey clients ttheymselves are growing. So that pays per control growth that you see in tthey employer services side that translates really into works that employee growth in tthey PEO. So that kind of magnifies tthey success of tthey business model. And it's a direct flow through because in employer services, tthey way we price tthey pays per control has an impact, which we've quantified for you in tthey PEO it's direct. Every employee that a client hires it's 100% incremental revenue to ADP and to TotalSource. So I think that tailwind from strong pays per control growth is something that we've been cautioning and guiding people that it will abate both in employer services and in tthey PEO and that will create a theyadline growth number for works that employees that will be lower than it was in tthey last quarter, but I still feel pretty good that we'll be able to have, I'm hoping double digit growth for some time. I'm not talking about short-term guidance for 2023, I'm just -- our goal in tthey PEO is to keep growing double digits, yes. Tien-Tsin Huang No allergic reaction from Danny. Ttheyre has been a double digit figure out ttheyre on tthey long-term, so no doubt about that. Danyal Hussain On revenue. Tien-Tsin Huang On revenues, I'm sorry on revenue. Carlos Rodriguez I did say revenue didn’t I? Tien-Tsin Huang Got to go back to tthey tape. Questions from tthey audience. Let's take some, we have a little under three minutes if ttheyre are any, ottheyrwise I'll keep going. Questions? Let's do Wisely. You know, I've used ttheir term probably in ottheyr interviews with you, Carlos, call it a sleeping giant from a FinTech perspective, because you touctheyd so many employees, many of which probably could have better mobile services from a banking perspective. So tell us about what tthey plan is for Wisely, because ttheyre are a lot of pure plays that are trying to do tthey same thing, but again, I feel like you have such a huge distribution advantage? Carlos Rodriguez We do, again, back to tthey distribution, we talked about tthey PEO having a distribution advantage. Ttheir is a little bit of a similar situation because we obviously pay so many people, we have ttheyir attention. We have ttheir mobile app wtheyre people go to ctheyck to see if ttheyy got paid. Ttheyy go to change ttheyir benefits, to add dependents. I mean, those are all opportunities to get somebody's attention. So it is a pretty big advantage in our opinion. We've got a lot more focus on ttheir than we had a year or two. We've done some org structure stuff to add, I think on tthey talent side to Wisely, but also to break it out as what we call now an emerging business, if you want, use whatever term you want to use, but we're pretty excited about it. We always were. I'd say we're super excited about it now just because of tthey focus and attention it's getting and tthey opportunity that you described, which is pretty, pretty large. Any employee who gets moved over to Wisely, tthey profitability compared to tthey float business for example, is multiples of what we get on tthey float side. So because you know, people always have wondered about ttheir float business in terms of, oh, interest rates might go down or payments might get sped up, but we have ttheir ottheyr thing called Wisely. Right? Which I think could actually make that into a net positive. Even though we don't technically call it float, you'd call it interchange fees or ottheyr fees, but ttheyre's a lot of upside ttheyre. So pretty excited about that business given tthey large installed base that we have and tthey connection we have that we're establishing with tthey employees of our clients. It's a learning process for us because theirtorically ADP's relationship really was with tthey clients ttheymselves, but technology has allowed us to build a relationship through mobile apps with tthey employees of our clients and theynce tthey Wisely opportunity. Tien-Tsin Huang Should I ask you about data or should we let you go? Let's wait three more seconds. Carlos Rodriguez No, you have to let me go, because we’re out of time. Tien-Tsin Huang We are out of time. We'll get you on tthey next time. More excuse, more reason for you to come back. Carlos, like I said, always a pleasure to talk to you. You're always very thoughtful and very balanced and I do value that. So thank you for tthey time. Carlos Rodriguez Thank you. Tien-Tsin Huang Thank you, Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez Thank you.
