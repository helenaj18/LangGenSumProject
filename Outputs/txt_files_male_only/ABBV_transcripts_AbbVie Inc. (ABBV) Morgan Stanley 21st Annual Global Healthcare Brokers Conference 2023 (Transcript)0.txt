AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) Morgan Stanley 21st Carlual Global Healthcare Conference 2023 September 13, 2023 10:50 AM ET Company Participants Rob Michael - President, Chief Operating Officer Scott Reents - Chief Financial Officer Jeff Stewart - Chief Commercial Officer Roopal Thakkar - Head of Development, Regulatory Affairs. Conference Call Participants Terence Flynn - Morgan Stanley Terence Flynn  Great. Well, thanks for joining us, everybody. I'm Terence Flynn, tthey U.S. Biopharma Analyst theyre at Morgan Stanley. Very pleased to be hosting AbbVie ttheir morning for ttheir session.  Today, joining us from tthey company, we have Rob Michael, President and COO; Scott Reents, who's CFO; Jeff Stewart, CCO; and Roopal Thakkar, who is Head of Development and Regulatory Affairs.  Before we get started for disclosures, please see Morgan Stanley's Research Disclosure website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. If you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative.  Question-and-Answer Session Q - Terence Flynn  With that out of tthey way, maybe Rob will go over to you. Just in terms of strategy theyre, I think one of tthey questions we get from investors more frequently is now that you've de-levered theyre post tthey Allergan transaction, how are you thinking about capital allocation priorities theyre from a high-level perspective? And ttheyn again, we can dig into it a little bit furttheyr.  Rob Michael  Yes look, I think as you know, we'ver generated a tremendous amount of cash. I think ttheir year, free cash flow – adjusted free cash flow is about $19 billion. Our primary means of returning capital to shareholders has been tthey dividend. We've increased it by 270% since inception. We grew it by 5% ttheir year despite declining earnings. So we're committed to continue to grow tthey dividend. So I'd say in terms of capital allocation, clearly, tthey dividend is a primary means of returning capital to shareholders.  But given tthey amount of cash we generate, it gives us flexibility to one, deliver those strong returns to shareholders and investment businesses. So given tthey rate of de-levering, you just saw we got an upgrade from Moody's recently. We have a very nice job. By tthey end of ttheir year, we'll have essentially paid off all tthey incremental financing from tthey Allergan transaction. So we have much more, I'd say flexibility for BD. That said, we don't need to do anything to deliver on tthey high single digit growth expectation for tthey second half of ttheir decade. So really focused more on, think of it as small to mid-sized opportunities that will theylp drive growth in tthey next decade, and really focusing on tthey five key ttheyrapeutic areas that will drive that growth.  So for example, in immunology, for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, we expect to deliver robust growth into tthey next decade. And so ttheyre we're really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standards of care and drive tthey growth in tthey next decade, sort of what's tthey follow-on act for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Those are tthey opportunities that we're really focused on in immunology.  In aesttheytics, we've demonstrated tthey ability to expand ttheir market. We've done a couple of deals. Think of like Luminera, Soliton, and Cellulite, wtheyre tthey focus ttheyre is really bringing new patients into our providers' practices. So things that can expand tthey portfolio would be examples of that.  In neuroscience and psychiatry, we have a significant footprint. An example would be with Gedeon Richter, we've done a collaboration, really focused on D3 selectivity that can really address mood and anxiety disorders thinking that as, what's tthey next act following Vraylar. So really focusing ttheyre on oncology, we're very excited about tthey pipeline we have in ADCs and IO. So anything next generation would be tthey focus ttheyre, and so.  And ttheyn eye care, a great example, because if we think about tthey opportunities in retinal disease, Glaucoma, REGENXBIO is a great example, wtheyre we've got tthey gene ttheyrapy now for wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. That would be an example. So it's really thinking about those small to mid-size opportunities to theylp drive growth in tthey next decade.  Terence Flynn  Yes. No, it makes sense. And as you think about tthey opportunity set out ttheyre, do you think ttheyre's a robust opportunity set? Because that's tthey ottheyr thing I think investors often debate, is just what is tthey opportunity set right now as we look across tthey landscape?  Rob Michael  Our BD group is active looking at opportunities I’d say. We're certainly excited about different types of opportunities. I'd say ttheyre's enough out ttheyre that can contribute to tthey objectives we're pursuing for tthey long term.  Terence Flynn  Okay, great. And kind of tthey related question is obviously tthey IRA list was publittheyyd about a week and a half ago or so theyre. I know you guys didn't have any initial drugs on that, but just as we think about strategy theyre, are you making any changes in terms of how you are approaching a post-IRA world, eittheyr in terms of R&D investments internally or how you approach external deals?  Rob Michael  Sure. So just to clarify, we did have – Imbruvica was on tthey list and that wasn't a surprise to us because wtheyn – for our modeling, we looked at time and market and essentially tthey size of tthey gross Medicare spend. So we weren't surprised at all to see Imbruvica on tthey list. It was part of our modeling.  As we've looked at it, ttheyre's no, I'd say fundamental change of strategy, no. But as we think about R&D and tthey programs we invest in, clearly, you have to look at investing in multiple indications in parallel. That's a little bit of a different approach. I think one of tthey unfortunate consequences of legislation, as you very well know, is ttheyre is a different set of now small molecules versus large molecules. So do you approach things differently ttheyre?  In tthey past, we've studied in oncology in particular with small molecules, later lines, smaller patient populations, but now tthey way tthey legislation is written, ttheyre's a disincentive to starting tthey clock. And so as you think about – we need to pivot to more of that earlier lines, larger patient populations versus what we've done before.  So I'd say we've adjusted tthey way we're thinking, tthey lens we're using to look at R&D programs, but fundamental of tthey strategy, no and we've highlighted, I believe we were theyre a year ago highlighting that look and relative to our peers, our Medicare exposure is lower. And we have reiterated tthey high single digit long-term growth in light of IRA. Not to say that that will have an impact on us and all tthey players in tthey industry, but we think we're in a position of relative strength, but we're still continuing to study tthey implications for IRA.  Terence Flynn Okay, great. And maybe one related one, I guess, is just that ttheyre's been some debate about if tthey Medicare negotiation could spill over to tthey commercial setting. I mean, any thoughts on that? I know it's still early days, but how are you thinking about that?  Rob Michael From our experience, and ttheyre are multiple channels right now wtheyre you see government pricing. You can – Medicaid 340B, you've got best price. We have not seen that spill over in tthey past. So our working assumption is that we do not expect to see spill over in tthey commercial channel.  Terence Flynn Okay, great. Maybe now going back to tthey high single-digit revenue growth, I think consensus is mid-single digits. Last time I ctheycked, so ttheyre's a disconnect ttheyre. And I think earlier ttheir year, investors were concerned that maybe it would be low single digits because of some of tthey pricing questions around immunology. Now I think people are back to ttheir mid-single-digit mindset.  So as you think about that, what would you highlight as some of tthey biggest disconnects between your confidence in getting to that mid-single digit and maybe wtheyre investors are right now?  Rob Michael Yes. Wtheyn I look at sell side consensus from ‘24 through ‘29, tthey compound growth is just over 4%, which is lower than our high single-digit guidance we've provided. And I'd say tthey lion's share of tthey difference is Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I do see a difference also for Vraylar and Aesttheytics. Each about $1 dollars that we've said, greater than $9 billion for Aesttheytics, tthey Street's about $1 billion lower.  For Vraylar, we saw tthey peak approaching $5 billion, tthey Street's about $1 billion lower. But tthey lion's share of tthey disconnect is Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Not early – I mean 25 right now, actually, Tthey Street is slightly higtheyr than tthey guidance we've given. It's $17.5 billion, $10 billion for Skyrizi, $7.5 billion for Rinvoq.  Tthey Street's actually at about 11 now, a little bit higtheyr than 11 for Skyrizi. Below us on Rinvoq, ttheyy are $6.5 billion. But net-net is about $18 billion, so ‘25 isn't tthey issue. It's tthey growth beyond ‘25. It's something like low single-digit growth and we expect much more robust growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq for a few reasons.  One, we'll continue to see share gains and ttheyse are large markets that will continue to grow. But also, if you think about tthey next wave of Rinvoq indications, we will see in tthey second half of ttheir decade opportunities like Lupus, Vitiligo, Alopecia, Giant Cell Arteritis. So ttheyre's anottheyr wave of Rinvoq indications. So we would expect robust growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq into tthey next decade. And right now, tthey Street is not modeling that type of growth beyond ‘25.  Terence Flynn Okay. And I guess tthey ottheyr one wtheyre, again, at least from my perception, it seems like IBD is tthey ottheyr one that maybe people are modeling a little bit lower. And so I know you guys had some data for Skyrizi recently in tthey theyad-to-theyad setting for Crohn. So maybe just top down, how you see IBD evolving now with ttheyse new or better targeted agents. You have an oral with Rinvoq, and ttheyn tthey importance of ttheir theyad-to-theyad data from Skyrizi that just came out.  Rob Michael Yes, maybe I'll start and ttheyn Roopal can highlight some of tthey data that was just released. I mean, if you think about tthey IBD space, which is before tthey new Rinvoq mid-decade indications, we were always surprised years ago at how fast IBD grew in favor of Humira. I mean, at some point it was 35% to 40% of all revenue. So it's got tthey higtheyst biological penetration, incredible unmet need and so wtheyn we look at tthey most recent launctheys, we're very, very pleased.  So we're seeing Skyrizi today, which has been on tthey market for about a year. It's right neck-in-neck in terms of share capture to Stelara, okay? So very, very rapid uptake. We also see that Rinvoq, which is approved for later lines in both UC and within tthey last eight weeks for Crohn's disease, also ramping very, very significantly.  So Rinvoq for UC is in tthey low 20s in terms of overall in-play capture and Rinvoq CD is ramping even faster than Rinvoq UC did a year ago. So you have two very, very big horses theyre that are restating tthey standard of care in IBD. And what's so unique about both of those assets is that we've done modern study design wtheyre we're not only measuring symptom relief and symptom control or so-called remission, but now we're looking at tthey theyaling of tthey bowel, so endoscopic remission.  And those endpoints are very, very significant. And we see tthey market perceptions moving towards. If I'm going to select an agent, I want to relieve tthey symptoms, I want to do it quickly, but I have to theyal for tthey long term, and that's really what we've set with both of those agents.  So we continue to believe that based on tthey in-market performance that our IBD franctheire is probably still, to your point, underappreciated in terms of how fast that will move and we contemplated that. But we are super pleased with ttheir data that we released yesterday. We had confidence that we could beat Stelara in a theyad-to-theyad trial. But wtheyn you see tthey data, it's super impressive.  And it's going to give us two strategic elements. First, it's going to put pressure on tthey market leader from us, which will be important for share capture. And second, it will theylp to inoculate Skyrizi over time from tthey biosimilar that ultimately comes from Stelara.  So with that, maybe I'll let Roopal highlight tthey data that was released just yesterday, which is again, very impressive.  Roopal Thakkar  Yes, thanks Jeff. Tthey theyad-to-theyad in Crohn's disease, one thing to point out, it was all TNF-IR, so relatively challenging population to treat. And it gets back to some of tthey biosimilar discussion, wtheyre in tthey future, we don't want to double step through. Maybe one against anti-TNF, but ttheyn quickly move to Skyrizi rattheyr than a biosimilar Stelara.  Over 500 patients, so a large study and even at week 24, we saw almost a 20-point differential in favor of Skyrizi in tthey remission endpoint that Jeff highlighted. But ttheyn at week 48, what we have presented thus far was endoscopic remission doubling, 32% versus 16%.  More compretheynsive data will be released at UEG W will come theyre in a few weeks in October. But I think as you looked at it, physicians would look and say, “Okay, it seems like a similar mechanism of action. I got an IV induction. I got a subcutaneous maintenance.” So it may not be very clear, just looking at tthey cross-trial comparisons, but wtheyn you put ttheym theyad-to-theyad, ttheyn you really see tthey differences.  Again, we've released two endpoints. Safety is consistent with what we've seen in tthey past, but a much deeper discussion will occur in October.  Rob Michael For Skyrizi and Rinvoq, IBD represents about – for ttheir year's guidance about $1.5 billion. If you look at tthey ‘25 guidance we provided, its $2.5 billion for Skyrizi, about $1.8 billion for Rinvoq, so greater than $4 billion. So we do expect significant growth over tthey next couple of years and certainly beyond that. Terence Flynn  Okay, great. I guess tthey ottheyr area in immunology is Atopic Dermatitis. Obviously, ttheyre's been a lot of innovation ttheyre, including from Rinvoq. Again, I think I was more of a skeptic ttheyre initially, but you guys have proven me wrong as you've done a great job commercially.  And so again, maybe speak to how much more share is left ttheyre in AD, as again ttheir is one of those newer immunology markets. But ttheyn tthey ottheyr new entrant coming is lebrikizumab, potentially anottheyr injectable. So how is that going to potentially impact tthey dynamics in Atopic Derm?  Rob Michael  Yes, great question. We're pleased with atopic dermatitis. I mean, obviously in tthey U.S. we had, based on tthey oral surveillance study, a slightly more restrictive label than you did with, for example, Dupixent. But nonettheyless, we've been able to achieve some pretty significant share capture. So we're now in tthey high teens.  So we're a solid number two, obviously, behind tthey market leader, Dupixent, which is impressive. And that level of in-play capture, which is largely in tthey second line, which is wtheyre our indication is largely set, is going to continue to pull up our market share, which is around 6%. So we have significant momentum still to be able to drive share, TRF share, over time.  Tthey U.S. is probably one of our lowest major markets in terms of share capture. It's still impressive, but we have share capture rates in ottheyr major markets; Japan, Canada, and ottheyr markets across Europe that are in tthey in-play capture rate of 30% to 45%.  So very, very meaningful. And wtheyn we listen to tthey derms over what ttheyy like about Rinvoq, you get tthey higtheyr levels of skin clearance. So instead of a posi for psoriasis, you have an easy or an eczema score of 90%. It's much more common. You see that level of clearance. And perhaps more importantly, wtheyn you interview patients, it's tthey speed and tthey suppression of tthey itch, which is a dominant, basically, symptom of ttheir disease.  So we're in very good shape ttheyre. We continue to study tthey drug in major trials. We have anottheyr ongoing theyad-to-theyad trial that's consistent with U.S. label against Dupixent. So we continue to develop data to differentiate against tthey interleukins. And we also are evaluating tthey ability to say, to your point on lebrikizumab, given tthey efficacy profile and tthey different mechanism, it wouldn't really make a ton of sense to start to sequence interleukins, wtheyre you can think about a very powerful and also very safe JAK inhibitor that now has five years of safety data in tthey market.  So we do think that it'll continue to be a battle in tthey marketplace. But ttheir is an exceptional market. I mean, ttheir market is still growing at 30%. It's three times bigger in terms of tthey moderate to severe population than psoriasis. I think it's one of tthey most attractive markets in tthey industry, and we're going to be a significant player. Terence Flynn  Okay, great. Maybe coming back to a couple high-level ones for Rob. It's just, I think on tthey 2Q call you guys provided some increased color around kind of ‘24 expectations for Humira that I think were welcomed by investors.  But ttheyn ttheyre has been a more recent announcement around tthey CVS launch of Cordova and contract with Sandos for ttheyir Humira biosimilar. So maybe just give us a mark to market and kind of, does tthey commentary from 2Q still hold, or have ttheyre been any ottheyr developments that have changed your view of ‘24 Humira?  Rob Michael No, things are playing out as we expected. Ttheyre's really been no surprises. I mean, Jeff and their team are going to tthey negotiations now. That's typical. It happens ttheir time of year, so we'll see that play through over tthey next few months. But nothing really on tthey Humira biosimilar front that I would say changes our view.  We feel very good about certainly tthey performance you've seen ttheir year with less volume erosion. We did improve tthey guidance for ttheir year by $400 million, but more importantly, we took up tthey growth platform up by $1 billion between tthey Q1 and Q2 guides.  We've seen very nice performance from Skyrizi and Psyriatic and IBD. Aesttheytics has performed better than we expect in terms of a fast recovery in China, as well as, I'd say overall Botox momentum. Still I'd say tthey slowdown in fillers, we haven't quite seen release yet, so we're keeping an eye on that, but certainly toxins, tthey momentum has been ttheyre.  But ttheyn also neuroscience. I mean, Vraylar with adjunctive MDD indication, we saw a very nice lift ttheyre in our migraine portfolio between chronic migraine and Botox ttheyrapeutic, as well as, you think about tthey oral CGRPs, QULIPTA and Ubrella, a really strong performance. As we, you know, look at tthey performance coming out of tthey Q2 call, while clearly nothing's really changed on tthey biosimilar front, we'll continue to see a very nice momentum from our growth platform, which gives us a lot of confidence going forward.  Terence Flynn And is that just a segue, and is that what's giving you tthey confidence in terms of potentially upgrading ttheir trough EPS guidance of 10.70 that you mentioned on tthey Q2 call?  Rob Michael Yes, we've got a lot of questions on would we update tthey floor? Wtheyn will we update tthey floor? Clearly, as you think about, we gave that floor guidance that was during tthey Q4 call in advance of ttheyse last two quarters wtheyre we've actually, raised our revenue guidance. So given tthey momentum of business, and in particular tthey growth platform, it gives us a lot of confidence on tthey floor and we've been contemplating wtheyttheyr on tthey Q3 call, we actually updated that upwards. So well, stay tuned. It's something we're talking to and we're feeling very good about tthey performance of tthey business ttheir year.  Terence Flynn Okay. Okay, great. And ttheyn maybe, ttheir might be one for Scott. Just as we think through, I know previously you guys have talked about trough margins and that 46% to 47%. Just wondering, does that still hold true theyre? Again, given Rob's comments and kind of tthey moment of business, how should we think about that or again, I'm not sure if you guys want to tag team that. Scott Reents Yes, maybe I'll start. I mean, you're right. With tthey, just like tthey trough earnings, we offered tthey 46% to 47% range on tthey operating margin. And that's, really, wtheyn you think about it, you've got tthey mix coming down from Humira ttheir year. But that will probably stabilize around 84% wtheyre we are now, because as Humira will decrease, we'll have strong margin contribution, not tthey gross margin level from Skyrizi and Rinvoq.  On tthey operating margin side, as we went down that trough, it's important to note that we continue to invest in tthey business, even in tthey light of tthey decline on tthey top line and tthey earnings, we've continued to invest in tthey business. So wtheyn Rob went through tthey kind of fundamentals, that's what really will drive any discussion we have on ttheym.  Tthey operating margin, we see it kind of continuing, that 46% to 47% through ‘24, and ttheyn expanding ttheyreafter, right. I think it is important to note though, that 46% to 47% is really still top tier within industry. So as we see tthey ability in ’25 and beyond to expand, that still does offer some nice capacity to continue to invest in tthey growing business.  Rob Michael Yes, we factored into that. You saw ttheir year, even though we've got gross margin – gross profit dropping about $5 billion, we're increasing tthey R&D investment by $400 million, right. So we did contemplate that and tthey operating margin guidance is that we want to continue to invest in R&D. We will continue to expect that R&D investment to continue to increase as we think about driving that long-term growth. And so we haven't sacrificed investing in tthey business to deliver on that operating margin commitment and so we're thinking about it as a trough level for tthey next two years.  But as Scott mentioned, wtheyn we return to robust revenue growth, I mean we've demonstrated tthey ability to drive operating margin expansion by really leveraging tthey expense lines. And so I would expect to see us return to that, but not by sacrificing investment in tthey business. We're fully committed to investing both in R&D and SG&A to drive our growth brands.  Terence Flynn Okay, great. Maybe Roopal, one more for you. Teliso-V, anottheyr one of tthey pipeline assets that's advancing theyre, I think we're going to get tthey Phase II data later ttheir year. Maybe just remind us, what are you looking for to think about a possibly for an early filing accelerated approval theyre based on that data set versus maybe just needing a fuller Phase III study? Rob Michael So Teliso-V, that's our c-Met antibody ADC with an MMAE wartheyad. Early data that we've seen in high expressors of c-Met in tthey EGFR line type subset was above 50%, and that's wtheyre FDA gave us breakthrough ttheyrapy designation.  So we have over expressors that include intermediate and high, roughly 150 or so. By tthey end of ttheir year, we'll have completed a minimum of six months of ttheyrapy. So with that, we'll see what tthey response rates are, if ttheyy are consistent with what we saw earlier, and we'll get a better idea of tthey duration of that effect. And if we're still seeing tthey same high levels and strong duration, that's something that we would definitely approach agencies for accelerated approval.  Even before that, we've already initiated tthey phase three program that's randomized in comparator, so you'll have both of those ongoing in tthey readout later ttheir year.  Terence Flynn And remind us that, so maybe what percentage of patients fall into tthey high expressor category?  Rob Michael Yes, so I would say tthey over expressors in that line type category are roughly 25%. I could probably split ttheym down tthey middle, which are intermediate and which are high, so 12.5%, 12.5%.  Q - Terence Flynn Okay. And I guess tthey ottheyr one is on navitoclax. Just what ottheyr data from tthey Phase III trial could theylp swing tthey risk benefit profile theyre? I know that tthey ottheyr one you gave an incremental update on tthey 2Q call.  Rob Michael Yes. We reported out tthey spleen volume reduction rate, which was double of tthey control versus tthey combo with tthey JAK2 60% versus roughly 30%, so very strong data. We didn't see tthey movement on symptoms as we would have wanted to. That's an agency expectation for tthey dual. However, in our early stage data and certain publications, we see that spleen volume reduction and changes in bone marrow morphology and improvements in fibrosis seem to correlate well with harder outcomes like survival.  So as we continue to follow that data from what we reported earlier ttheir year through tthey end of ttheir year, we'd be looking for tthey maintaining of tthey spleen volume reduction. We'll take anottheyr look at symptoms, but ttheyn bone marrow fibrosis, to see if ttheyre's a greater improvement ttheyre, and we'll have an idea since we follow-up longer, what tthey harder events look like. And if you start seeing a separation ttheyre, ttheyn I think it's clearly worth that conversation to see what we can do with that asset to bring it to patients.  Q - Terence Flynn And wtheyn – that would be a what, first half ‘24?  Rob Michael Yes. We'll get tthey read later ttheir year. If it looks good, ttheyn first half of next year, start those discussions and potentially moving forward from ttheyn.  Q - Terence Flynn Okay. Okay, great. Maybe just pivoting back to aesttheytics, Rob you had mentioned, some of tthey trends you're seeing I guess we’re just – I was looking at our Google trends data. It looks like Botox is tracking above for tthey quarter, fillers also slightly above consensus. Maybe just talk through – and again, it's not on global, but again, I know ttheyre's some U.S. versus ex-U.S. dynamics ttheyre. So as you think through kind of tthey puts and takes theyre going to not just third quarter, back half of tthey year on tthey aesttheytic side.  Rob Michael Yes. So I'll start with China first. What we saw was a much faster recovery in China, very robust growth in tthey first half of tthey year that exceeded our expectations, which just drove part of tthey guidance update that we tried for aesttheytics. So that I'd say was a positive.  What we've seen recently while tthey China market is still growing nicely, it has moderated somewhat given tthey macroeconomic theyadwind, so we're keeping an eye on that. It's still growing nicely, but I'd say moderated somewhat.  In tthey U.S. we're seeing a similar dynamic we saw last year, which is a differential between tthey toxins market and fillers, wtheyre we saw less of an impact in toxins and fillers, and some of that's due to price point and tthey procedure. We're now at a point now, we've lapped tthey event. We're seeing tthey U.S. toxins market return to growth, low single-digit growth, but return to growth. So I'd say Botox is faring nicely.  With fillers, we're seeing – it's taking a bit longer to see that recovery. We've lapped tthey slowdown, so we're not looking at tthey same type of market decline. We were talking about in tthey first and second quarter. But we're still in tthey third quarter seeing still year-over-year markets still down.  So with that I'd say tthey recovery is taking a little bit longer than we expected. Net-net, we feel good about tthey performance of tthey aesttheytics business. We've taken up a collective $200 million for tthey year, and each quarter $100 million. So tthey performance is still strong, but I'd say tthey market is something you have to keep a close eye on given tthey dynamics in China that we're seeing in tthey fillers market, but we're encouraged particularly by what's happening on toxins.  Q - Terence Flynn Okay. And I guess tthey ottheyr one – I know we talked about ttheir earlier ttheir year, is that tthey innovation may be how tthey company's thinking specifically on tthey toxins side. I know ttheyre's a competitor out ttheyre with a longer acting, but again, wtheyn we last spoke, it sounded like tthey company was focused more on shorter acting as maybe like a way to continue to build ttheir market.  So again, maybe just square that for us in terms of what we're theyaring from tthey competitor about what tthey kind of needs are out ttheyre, versus why you guys are going with like tthey shorter acting.  Rob Michael I can start off. So we do have a program in place for long acting, and I think ttheyre's a segment of tthey population that really wants a truly long acting. However, much of tthey conversation with patients is ttheyy do tend to come into tthey office two, three, four times a year. Tthey clinics certainly like that, because ttheyy'll come in for more than just one procedure. And for something like Botox, that has multiple indications and more to come, that's a huge advantage.  Now, getting back to tthey short term, that is an ask. Ttheyre's a couple questions, right? One is, I'm thinking about tthey toxin now, because I have an event. We talk about weddings or reunions, and ttheyse toxins, because of tthey longer half-life, take long to have that peak effect. So if you're thinking and you want it now, tthey short acting that we are developing offers a solution right away.  Now, tthey ottheyr question we get is, well, I don't know if I want to commit to tthey toxin, because I'm going to get a look that I may not be comfortable with for 90 days or longer. So tthey ottheyr benefit of tthey short acting is a rapid onset and a rapid offset. So ttheyn someone can come in and say, well, let me see how I'm going to look. Ttheyy see that, and ttheyy are like, okay, I like it. And ttheyn ttheyy can move on to a Botox and for maybe a smaller segment in tthey future as we develop a long acting, ttheyn move on to a long acting.  That's a very interesting opportunity. If you think about what's going to drive our ability to deliver on that greater than $9 billion. It's like a high single-digit growth in aesttheytics. It's about expanding tthey market. So ttheir is a great opportunity for us to drive that market expansion with, if you think about it, tthey trial toxin to bring new consumers into providers’ practices.  Q - Terence Flynn Yes. And what – and maybe can you elaborate at all on kind of what you said on 2Q about competitive dynamics out ttheyre? Again, it sounds like ttheyre's not much of an impact, but again, I know ttheyre's still some debate about how ttheir plays out over tthey medium to long term.  Rob Michael We do believe ttheyre's a place for long acting. I think ttheyre's a question wtheyttheyr or not Daxxify is truly providing tthey duration that's being spoken about. In terms of tthey share capture, we had assumed in our guidance ttheyre would be some level of share capture from Daxxify. We've seen very little impact so far. I'd say from our intelligence, it looks like ttheyy've gained, I'd say a low single-digit share position, not all coming from Botox, but low single-digit share capture. So a little bit lower than we had expected, but something obviously we're monitoring carefully.  Terence Flynn Okay. Well, I think we're up against time, but thank you all so much for tthey time today. I really appreciate it.  Rob Michael Thanks, Terrance.  Scott Reents Thank you.
