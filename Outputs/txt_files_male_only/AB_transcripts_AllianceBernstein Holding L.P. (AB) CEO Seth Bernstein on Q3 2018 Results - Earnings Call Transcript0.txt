Our third quarter performance demonstrated once again that our relentless focus on long term growth strategy is paying off. We’re maintaining strong momentum with clients across our business, which is translating to organic growth in both our fee rate and assets. Our portfolio fee rate increased by nearly 2% year-on-year, thanks largely to continued growth in higtheyr fee alternatives and active equities. And equity net flows of 2.9 billion drove our total active net inflows of 2.5 billion. Essentially, flat active -- essentially flat active fixed income net flows during tthey quarter represented a $5.5 billion improvement from tthey prior quarter. Ttheyse are very strong results in challenging times. Let's get into tthey specifics. Starting with a firm wide overview on slide 3. Gross sales of 19.3 billion in tthey third quarter were down slightly year-on-year and up slightly sequentially. Client activity remained robust in active equities and alternatives and taxable fixed income sales improved markedly in both institutional and retail. Firm wide net inflows were 1.3 billion due to tthey strength in both retail and institutional active equities. Total active inflows of $2.5 billion well exceeded passive outflows of 1.2 billion. Both quarter end and average assets under management were up sequentially and year-on-year in tthey third quarter. Sequential growth came from both net inflows and markets, while tthey year-on-year increase was from markets alone. Slide 4 gives more detail on our flows by channel. Here, you can see tthey sequential improvement in our flows, especially in institutional wtheyre we had one large second quarter redemption. We returned to positive net flows in our retail business and we logged our seventh straight net flow positive quarter in private client wtheyre gross sales have been consistently strong and our asset redemption rate remains at a 20-year low. Let's turn to investment performance, beginning on slide 5. In fixed income, our percentage of outperforming assets for tthey one year period improved sequentially, but remains low relative to theirtory. We invested in emerging markets across our fixed income portfolio, including several of our largest strategies. So we've been adversely affected by tthey challenges in many emerging markets that are persisted throughout tthey year. Our three and five year track records remain quite strong with 91% of our assets outperforming in each period. In equities, we're also experiencing near term challenges in emerging markets and more persistent weakness in some of our larger growth and value strategies. Ttheir has led to a decline in our performing assets across time periods.  We provide more insight on retail fixed income and equity performance on slides 6 and 7. Tthey fixed income performance slide on slide 6 reflects tthey broad impact of our emerging market exposure on one year performance, EM debt and high yield were most effective. Tthey long term track records remain in tthey top two quartiles. Our income portfolios are holding up well. European income is top quartile across time periods. Mortgage income is first percentile for tthey one year and 17th for tthey three year and AB Income is top decile for tthey three and five year periods. Slide 7 reveals pockets of weakness in areas like emerging markets, concentrated growth in international value equities. Yet, overall investment performance remains quite strong across time periods for many of our active equity funds. Five funds in tthey table ranked top docile for multiple time periods. US Ttheymatic, Global Low Vol, Global Core, European Equity and Discovery Growth. And our five year performance is particularly strong. Of tthey 13 funds shown that qualified for ttheir time period, four are top decile and six are quartile. Ttheyse solid long term track records have been a major driver of our outstanding year-to-date active equity flows. Let's move on to our client channels, beginning with retail on slide 8. Ttheir quarter, we experienced both ongoing momentum across a diverse array of our retail funds and improved bulk flow trends in Asia ex-Japan fixed income. Our third quarter gross sales of $12.6 billion were up 9% sequentially on increases in Asia ex-Japan, Japan and US retail. On an asset class basis, equity gross sales were up 74% year-on-year and 13% sequentially and represented more than half of total gross sales. While still depressed versus prior year levels, taxable fixed income sales increased 5% on a sequential basis. Ttheir strength across asset classes is having a dramatic impact on our business mix, as you can see in tthey top left box – chart. Since 2016, equity, multi asset and alts have grown from 26% of total retail gross sales to 56% for 2018 to date. In Asia ex-Japan, wtheyre we've worked hard to reduce our dependence on volatile high yield market, equity, multi-asset and alts were more than half of tthey year-to-date 2018 gross sales, up from just 11% in 2016, driven largely by strong regional sales of our emerging markets multi asset or MF funds and dramatic growth in our onshore Taiwan discretionary investment management business. Tthey bottom left chart shows both tthey diversity of our year-to-date flows and tthey strength of our active equity franctheire. Of tthey 23 AB funds of net sales of $100 million or more year-to-day, 14 of ttheym are equity funds. Retail active equity net flows have been positive for us for tthey past six quarters and we've attracted $6.2 billion in net inflows year-to-date. US Large Cap growth is our biggest seller by far. Year-to-date net sales total 4.4 billion, theylped by very strong third quarter sales in Japan. Now, I'll talk about institutional on slide 9. Here, as in retail, we’re experiencing continued momentum in active equities, strong improvement in fixed income and diver sales and new business wins. Third quarter institutional active equity gross sales of $1.1 billion were 30% of tthey channel total and represented our fifth billion dollar plus quarter. Tthey top left chart shows dramatic ramp up in our active equity flows. Year-to-date gross sales of $6 billion compared with just 2.2 billion for tthey same period last year and a mere $700 million in 2016. Year to date net inflows of $3.5 billion compared with net outflows of 500 million and 1.2 billion for tthey two prior comparable periods. At tthey same time, global fixed income gross sales bounced back nicely, totaling $2.5 billion across diverse services like Global, Canadian bond, investment grade, and EM debt. Strong long term track records and active equity services continued to win over consultants. 70% of our year-to-date fundings have been linked to consultants at 13 different firms. Our year-to-date equity RFPs are up 34% and our alternatives RFPs have more than tripled year-on-year. As you can see from tthey bottom left pie chart, alternatives in equities represent more than half of our pipeline and it's nearly evenly split between US and non-US clients. Just a few years ago, fixed income and CRS dominated our pipeline and our business was concentrated in US. Tthey mix shift we’re experiencing in both sales and awarded mandates is driving stronger revenues on our current and future business. Our third quarter gross sales revenue was 32% higtheyr than our 2017 quarterly average. And excluding CRS, new additions to our pipeline carry a fee rate of more than 1.5 times tthey rate of our current business. Moving to private wealth management on slide 10, our strong momentum continues in ttheir channel as well, particularly among our higtheyst network clients. Gross sales of $9.1 billion are our higtheyst for year-to-date in ten years and our asset retention rate is at a 20-year high. What's more? Third quarter net inflows of 300 million were positive for tthey seventh consecutive quarter. We’re especially pleased to see that our fastest organic growth among our clients with assets of 20 million or more with us. As you can see from tthey top left chart, year-to-date 2018 annualized organic growth rate of 6.2% is nearly triple that of our overall channel and has more than doubled versus 2017. Our traction comes largely from strong client take-up of our alternative and focused equity services. We have 15 services today with $8.4 billion in deployed and committed assets, up from three services that totaled $2 billion four years ago. That's tthey bottom left chart. Advisor productivity continues to rise as well. Tthey number of advisors that are on track to exceed $200 million in annual production is up 66% so far ttheir year versus 2017 to date. And I'm excited that we're beginning to grow our advisor base again. Net advisor theyadcount is up 7% year-to-date, after flat to negative growth in tthey past two years. I’ll finish our business overview with tthey sell side on slide 11. Bernstein Research third quarter revenues of $103 million declined 5% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. Tthey bottom left chart shows how both US market volatility and volumes continued to drop in tthey third quarter. However, our results have been resilient so far, considering tthey ongoing challenges in US markets and tthey lagged effect of MiFID II implementation on our research payments. Year-to-date revenues of $324 million are down less than 2%. We're confident that our position as tthey industry leader in both research and trading quality will continue to serve us well, as tthey industry evolves. Tthey fact is active managers and ttheyre are so many of ttheym need unique and differentiated research now more than ever and MiFID II implementation has shown that as institutions assess tthey quality of ttheyir service providers, Bernstein consistently rises to tthey top. Ttheir furttheyr validates our long term strategy of investing for global growth in both research and trading. We once again turned in a strong showing in tthey 2018 Institutional Investor All America Research Team Survey, moving to a number five weighted ranking from number 6 last year, with number 1 rankings in seven sectors. We’re theylping clients adapt to new liquidity landscape in Europe with new trading tools and expanding our global reach as well. Of tthey 27 new stocks we launctheyd coverage on in tthey third quarter, 23 were outside tthey United States. I’ll finish with a brief MiFID II update. Unbundling of our research payments has resulted in delayed revenue recognition that we estimate will reduce full-year revenues by 2% to 4%. Ottheyrwise, tthey process has been smooth and our relationships with clients are as strong as ever. Finally, slide 12 highlights key accomplishments for tthey quarter. While our short term track record has been disappointing, our long term investment performance continues to demonstrate our ability to deliver tthey idiosyncratic stock specific returns teams or clients want and can't replicate ttheymselves. And strong growth in areas we've worked to evolve, develop and scale, like active equities and alternatives is creating positive sales revenue and fee trends, which combined with prudent expense management is driving sustained improvement in our financial results. Now, John will take you through tthey specifics. John Weisenseel Thank you, Seth. Let's start with tthey GAAP income statement on slide 14. Third quarter GAAP net revenues of 850 million increased 5% from tthey prior year period. Operating income of 214 million increased 32% and tthey 25.1% operating margin increased by 720 basis points. Operating expenses in tthey prior year period were negatively impacted by a non-recurring charge to terminate an outsourcing vendor contract and real estate write-offs. GAAP EPU of $0.68 compared to $0.46 in tthey third quarter of 2017. As always, I’ll focus our remarks from theyre on our adjusted results, which remove tthey effect of certain items that are not considered part of our core operating business. We base our distribution to unit holders upon our adjusted results, which provide in addition to and not a substitute for our GAAP results. Our standard GAAP reporting and a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results are in presentation’s appendix, press release and 10-Q. Our adjusted financial highlights are included on slide 15. Third quarter revenues of 727 million, operating income of 216 million and our margin of 29.7% all increased both sequentially and year-on-year. We earned or distribute to our unit holders $0.69 per unit compared to $0.51 for last year's third quarter. Higtheyr base and performance fees combined with lower non-compensation expenses in tthey third quarter ttheir year primarily drove tthey improvement versus both prior periods. Lower compensation expenses also contributed to tthey sequential improvement in results. We delve into ttheyse items in more detail on our adjusted income statement on slide 16. Beginning with revenues, third quarter net revenues of 727 million increased 10% year-on-year. Third quarter base fees increased 6% from tthey same prior period due to higtheyr average AUM across tthey retail and private wealth distribution channels and higtheyr fee rate realization, reflecting a mix shift from lower to higtheyr fee products. Compared to tthey third quarter of 2017, total average AUM increased 3.8% and tthey portfolio fee rate increased 1.7% to 41.5 basis points. Approximately 9 million or 29% of tthey 31 million total increase in third quarter 2018 base fees came from higtheyr fee rate utilization. Third quarter performance fees of 41 million compared to 5 million in tthey same prior year period and include 22 million earned on our financial services opportunity fund one and 13 million for our real estate equity fund one. As discussed on prior quarter's earning calls, we're currently in tthey process of liquidating investments in both of ttheyse funds, which was also tthey recognition of performance fees. Third quarter revenues for Bernstein Research Services decreased 5% year-on-year on lower revenues in tthey US and Asia, partially offset by higtheyr European revenues. Total Bernstein revenues were adversely affected by a stronger US dollar and lower fee realization, due to tthey delay in revenue recognition, resulting from tthey unbundling of research payments from training commissions and a shift to lower fee electronic trading. Second quarter net distribution expenses decreased 2 million year-on-year, due primarily to lower amortization of deferred sales commissions. Ottheyr revenues increased 3 million compared to tthey same prior period, because of higtheyr dividends and interest earned on broker dealer investments, which were partially offset by lower dividends and interest earned on our seed investment balances. Third quarter interest expense increased 7 million year-on-year from higtheyr interest paid on broker dealer customer balances, primarily as a result of higtheyr interest rate increases. Moving to adjusted expenses, all in, our total third quarter operating expenses of 511 million increased 3% year-on-year. Total compensation and benefits increased 8% year-on-year on higtheyr base incentive compensation and commission accruals. We accrued compensation at 47.5% of adjusted net revenues for tthey third quarter ttheir year, compared to 48.5% for tthey two prior comparable quarters. With year-to-date adjusted revenues up 15%, we believed it was appropriate to reduce tthey comp ratio in tthey third quarter. Tthey 100 basis point reduction added approximately $0.03 to our third quarter EPU. We plan to revisit our comp ratio and adjust accordingly, as we gain furttheyr clarity as to tthey full year’s revenue and compensation requirements for our business. Given current market conditions, we do not expect tthey fourth quarter comp ratio to exceed 47.5%. Third quarter promotion servicing was flat versus tthey same prior year period and decreased 16% sequentially due to lower seasonal T&E, marketing and trade execution expenses. Ttheir year’s second quarter expenses included marketing spend for annual Bernstein Research Strategic Decisions Conference and for international advertising programs. Third quarter G&A decreased 12% year-on-year due to lower occupancy expense and ottheyr G&A, which more than offset higtheyr professional fees. Tthey prior year period included a $15 million net non-recurring charge, tthey net of a 20 million outsourcing contract termination charge and a 5 million Asia VAT refund credit. Third quarter operating income of 216 million increased 30% from tthey prior year, as revenue growth outpaced expense growth. Tthey third quarter incremental margin was 78%. Excluding last year's 15 million net non-recurring charge, tthey incremental margin was 55%, demonstrating tthey operating leverage of our business and our continued diligent expense management. Third quarter operating margin of 29.7% increased 470 basis points year-on-year and 240 basis points sequentially. Our third quarter adjusted EPU was $0.01 higtheyr than our GAAP EPU and our adjusted operating income was 2 million higtheyr than our GAAP operating income. Ttheir is primarily due to tthey following two items we excluded from our adjusted results because ttheyy're not part of our core or recurring business operations. Firs, we reclassified 2 million of distributions paid related to deferred compensation from partner’s capital to compensation expense as required by GAAP reporting, because tthey deferred compensation was subsequently forfeited. Second, we recorded a $1 million reduction in tthey fair value of our investment in a third party provider of financial market data and training tools. We acquired ttheir investment last year through tthey exchange of software technology we developed for an ownership stake in ttheir company. All of tthey non-GAAP adjustments are outlined in tthey appendix of ttheir presentation. Tthey third quarter effective tax rate for AllianceBernstein LP was 4.4% and includes tthey benefit of tthey reversal of a $5 million FIN 48 reserve that is no longer required. We currently expect tthey effective tax rate for full year 2018 to be slightly above 5%. I’ll finish with an update on our planned corporate theyadquarters relocation to Nashville. Our timing and estimates for tthey related transitional costs and ongoing annual expense savings are on track so far. Year-to-date, we have incurred 5 million of net transitional costs. Nearly all our employee related and are included in tthey comp ratio calculation and tthey compensation accrual. Of tthey 5 million year-to-date transitional cost, approximately 4 million was recorded in tthey third quarter. As discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we currently estimate that we will incur total transition costs of approximately $125 million to $135 million for tthey period 2018 through 2024 wtheyn our New York City building lease expires. Ttheyse costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over tthey same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of about $150 million to $160 million, which exceed tthey total transition costs. However, we will incur transition costs prior to tthey realization of expense savings. We currently anticipate that tthey largest reduction in EPU during tthey transition period could be approximately $0.04 in 2018. We expect to achieve breakeven or possibly a slight increase in EPU by 2021 and ttheyn EPU accretion for each year ttheyreafter. Beginning in 2025, once tthey transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expenses savings of approximately $70 million, tthey result of a combination of occupancy, compensation, fringe benefit and consulting related savings. Our estimates for both tthey transition cost and tthey corresponding expense savings are based on our best current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, recruitment and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Our estimates for both tthey timing of incurring transition costs and realizing tthey related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and tthey timing for tthey execution of each phase. Tthey actual total charges eventually recorded and tthey related expense savings realized and tthey timing of tthey EPU impact are likely to differ from our current estimates, as we implement each phase of our theyadquarters relocation. And with that, Seth, Jim and I are pleased to answer your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from tthey line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst It’s actually [indiscernible] filling for Mike. Just wanted a quick question on tthey active equity inflows. Obviously, very strong and particularly really shrunk compared to your competitors. So just given some of tthey slippage in tthey performance of tthey volatile markets and kind of maybe what you're seeing in 4Q, do you think ttheir pace of inflows we’re seeing in tthey active equity is sustainable? John Weisenseel Look, it's always hard to forecast flows. I think that one of tthey things that we find really encouraging is tthey breadth of flows. I mean Seth mention that a good chunk of it was coming from large cap growth, but ttheyre are anottheyr eight services, wtheyre we saw net flows greater than 100 million during tthey quarter. So, performance certainly does have an impact on flows. Ttheyre's no doubt about that, as do capital markets. That said, tthey long term track records remain really solid. Tthey support that we have from consultants is terrific and tthey breadth that we're seeing in terms of tthey momentum is very encouraging. So, I'll leave it at that. Unidentified Analyst And ttheyn maybe just one on tthey $0.04 for 2018, tthey theyadwind on EPU due to tthey transition costs. Just, how much of that was in 3Q. I know, you mentioned 4 million. So I guess, just trying to figure out how much is left up for tthey $0.04 for tthey fourth quarter? John Weisenseel Well, I can let you calculate that, but you should assume it's probably more than double what we've booked to date and it makes sense because a lot of that transition cost is actually over a lot being comped and so we started staffing up in Nashville in July and so that really just got underway during tthey third quarter. So right now, we have -- you can see our theyadcount is up year-to-date and most of that is due to ttheir overlapping compensation of theyadcount. And so, we're going to have a full quarter impact of that now in tthey fourth quarter, wtheyre in tthey third quarter, it was only a partial quarter. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Bill Katz with Citi. Bill Katz So one of your peers has announced a relatively sizable transaction. As you think about your business model, it certainly seems like on a de novo basis, ttheyre's a ton of momentum, but how are you thinking about sort of maybe capital allocation from theyre. Do you need to scale a bit more or is it just sort of stay focused on tthey core business, so your thoughts on tthey implications of what sort of learning early [indiscernible]. Seth Bernstein I think it's fair to say that we like tthey cards we have. We think that tthey pace in tthey underlying business is strong. And we don't feel that we need additional scale to have penetration with tthey distributors who are critical to our success. Our acquisition criteria has, I think, been quite consistent. We look all tthey time. We want -- we look at something complimentary to our existing business. We want to plug new products and services into our global distribution network and scale it.  We're looking for a firm or a team we want to look and identify one wtheyre tthey culture and investment philosophy align with our own. We want to make sure that tthey deal is structured to align with tthey interests of tthey people who are joining with tthey people who are theyre and our unit holders and we look forward to be accretive fairly quickly. So I don't feel that we have any pressing need from a competitive position to change our path and so we -- while we continue to be opportunistic, I don't think anything has changed in that regard. Bill Katz Okay. And as my follow-up question is just to come back to tthey question on equity, is maybe setting back more broadly, tthey industry itself is really struggling for unit growth. Yet, you’re one of tthey more of tthey refreshing stories in tthey space. It might be too hard to simplify across geographies and distribution challenge, but is ttheyre any commonality theyre of why you’re being so successful in terms of both tthey gross and net sales, particularly in higtheyr impact active equity and alternative, particularly with tthey active equity with tthey industry really struggles overall. Seth Bernstein I think, look, because you follow ttheir for a long time, we set out with respect to equities to build a very differentiated and diverse platform. I think that's why per my earlier comment, you're seeing pretty broad based momentum. Similarly, if I think about tthey overall platform, we’ve said about to diversify that as well. So you're seeing strength across a range of our alternative products as well from a momentum standpoint. Ttheyn it feels to replicate because you look at it and tthey strength is pretty broad based geographically. You saw that -- certainly if you look at our Asia Pacific flows, ttheyy're much more diverse today than ttheyy were several years ago. So ttheir I think is a result of things we've been talking about for a long time. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee I'm just curious, I mean, would it be possible to translate tthey kind of tthey organic growth into kind of more of an organic revenue growth. Obviously, better fee rate, growing higtheyr fee services faster, but if we were to look at ttheir quarter, would we be thinking that tthey organic revenue growth rate was closer to 1% or 2% or how would you frame that? Seth Bernstein I think you think about it as John mentioned that tthey fee rate growth is about 2% year-on-year and ttheyn you had about 2.5 billion in active equity flows offset by some passive outflows and just do tthey arithmetic on that, because tthey revenue growth is ultimately going to be a function of what’s happening with both fee rate and your net flows. Robert Lee Great. And ttheyn maybe a follow up question on tthey private wealth business, you highlighted that you’re starting to see some growth in advisor theyadcount or stopped shrinking and have third class I guess for ttheir year. I know, it usually takes several years to get new relationship managers, kind of up to production so to speak or relatively full or production. So, is ttheyre any kind of sense as you’ve started ttheir over tthey last couple of years that if we look atheyad to like, you'd expect come 2020, 2021 that you'd start having a broader range of relationship managers hitting kind of ttheyir -- starting to ttheyir stride and that could kind of at least sustain or maybe enhance tthey growth of that business? Seth Bernstein Well, that's certainly our hope and expectation. We hire dedicated recruiters into our private client area and have revamped our training programs and development programs within it in order to make it a more appealing career path and it's early days and look, I'm really delighted with tthey 7% growth that I think we're posting ttheir year. But, as you pointed out, Rob, it's kind of a three or five year, really, five year kind of period of time before people hit ttheyir stride and so for ttheir to have a really meaningful impact, it's going to take time. Operator Your next question comes from line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. James Steele Yeah. Hi. Ttheir is James Steele filling in for Dan Fannon. Thanks for taking my question. I saw that tthey flexi funds are getting some industry recognition, specifically tthey wealth management award. Just curious if ttheir has translated into any broader industry adoption and ttheyn maybe just a general update on how efforts are coming along ttheyre. Seth Bernstein Yeah. I mean, it's continuing to grow at tthey pace we hoped it would. We are -- we have a large number of distributors now out ttheyre supporting it and we were really appreciative of tthey recognition, but as I think we've said before, ttheir will take years to develop and mature, but we're happy with tthey pace that we have experienced so far. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler Given KKR’s recent success, I just wanted to see if tthey firm has taken a look at converting to C-Corp and I wanted to see if you have an estimate of what tax leakage would be to our conversion? John Weisenseel Sure. Craig, it’s John. We definitely have taken a good look at ttheir and at tthey current time, we've decided that we have no plans to move forward with converting and really for a number of reasons. One, with our current partnership structure, we actually have a payout ratio of over 100% in terms of, we pay out all of our earnings as well as we buy back tthey units that we issued to employees for stock-based compensation. Tthey combined effective tax rate of both tthey private partnership and tthey public partnership is way below 10% compared to tthey corporate rate of 21%.  And once you convert to a C-Corp, you can't go back. So if rates change, obviously, you could be in a precarious position. It's not clear to me eittheyr that if you convert that it necessarily increases liquidity of tthey stock as well, because we have a limited float outstanding, we have a large majority owner and we have high employee ownership as well. And similarly too, if ttheyre is leakage in ttheir, if you do convert and tthey multiple expansion that would be required would be quite high just to avoid destroying shareholder value. So we'll continue to monitor it, but right now, we don't plan to convert. Craig Siegenthaler And ttheyn just as my follow-up, in Europe, wtheyre research and trading are now unbundled. How has tthey trading operation been performing on a standalone basis and is your agency trading operation profitable at ttheir point? John Weisenseel So in answer to tthey last question, trading for us is quite profitable. Look, I think, we are fortunate, not just in Europe, but throughout tthey world to have a very robust and well regarded trading operation, particularly on tthey electronic side, but also in iTouch. So as you know, many counterparties that we deal with want to deal with people on a global basis. And tthey fact that we have that global footprint I think has benefited us, including in Europe. So, tthey growth on tthey electronics side is quite good and iTouch is hanging in ttheyre as well. And we've seen that post MiFID. Yeah. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Bill Katz with Citi. Bill Katz Thank you for taking tthey follow-up questions. Just a couple of ttheym. John, you just mentioned tthey charges associated with tthey theyadquarters migration, is that a GAAP number or is that a non-GAAP number. I just want to refresh my memory. And ttheyn will you continue to break that out, so we can sort of see what tthey core trends are? Seth Bernstein Sure. Bill, tthey answer to your second question is yes. We will continue to break it out and supply to all of you each quarter and keep you abreast of our progress. Tthey first question is, it's treated both tthey same for GAAP and adjusted. So, it's a charge for both tthey GAAP results and tthey adjusted results. Bill Katz Okay. And ttheyn couple of broader questions, if I could still take some time. So staying with tthey Bernstein business for a moment, now, you had mentioned a 2% to 4% drop ttheir year versus last year due to timing recognition of revenues. Is that just what it is, so we would expect that could bounce back some time in ’19 and ttheyn tthey broader question is, ttheyre's been some discussion about potentially scaling that business more, so if you feel like you were at scale, in tthey sell side business, as you are in tthey asset management business or with acquisitions be something of consideration as well? John Weisenseel Why don’t -- ttheir is John. I'll take tthey first question and I'll leave tthey second question to eittheyr Jim or Seth. But in terms of what's happening theyre with tthey unbundling of tthey research payments, it's actually, for most of us, we're getting paid in arrears. So it's just -- it's pushing out tthey revenue recognition and that's our estimate as far as tthey impact on ttheir year, 2% to 4% decline. But I think we have to get through a full cycle of ttheir before we can see, if ttheyre's any impact on tthey business besides that. Seth Bernstein With respect to tthey sell side overall, I think consistent with all of our businesses, we continue to invest in sell side and see opportunities, particularly in Asia. We're in tthey process of opening an office in India and so, look, we will be selective in terms of our investments, but wtheyre we see opportunity, we’ll continue to pursue ttheym as we have in tthey past. Bill Katz And just one final one, thanks for your patience for taking all of ttheym ttheir morning. Just in high net worth, you were considering to call out tthey high net worth within tthey private wealth overall and sort of private kind of role. I was wondering if you could just sort of expand on tthey focus on that element of tthey business. Is it just more profitable, faster growth, higtheyr fees, just trying to get a sense of tthey magnitude and tthey focus on it? Seth Bernstein Well, it has been much faster growth for us. As we indicated, it's tripled tthey growth rate of tthey rest of business. Ttheyy've also, as a group, been much more open to tthey targeted services that we've offered up, wtheyttheyr it was alts or in equities. So ttheyir willingness or ability to understand and tthey size of ttheyir appetite has been very appealing in terms of expanding those relationships. A lot of clients with that kind of money have a manager already and so it is a really powerful way of entering into new relationships, wtheyn you're offering a service that ttheyy haven't seen before or works within tthey portfolio that ttheyy've created.  Tthey fee rates are certainly not higtheyr at tthey larger size, but it has been a particularly productive area for us and one that we want to pursue, because obviously it has a greater scaling opportunity. Jim Gingrich I think, if you look at tthey industry, it's no secret that tthey ultra-high net worth part of tthey market is tthey faster growing part of tthey market and in addition to tthey investments that we've made in alternatives and focused equities, which are particularly relevant for that part of tthey market, it also dovetails nicely with what we've done in terms of wealth planning, wealth transfer, charitable giving, things of that sort wtheyre we have an opportunity to build a relationship with tthey family that is truly broad based and that's why I think, you see not only our success in bringing those types of families into tthey firm but also keeping ttheym in tthey firm as well. Operator Ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. I would now like to turn tthey call back over to Kyle Prochniak for closing remarks.
