Before we discuss tthey quarter, I'd like to begin with tthey announcement we made last night regarding Tom Tedford becoming ACCO Brands next Chief Executive Officer on October 1st. He will also be joining tthey Board of Directors at that time. I could not be more pleased to announce Tom as my successor. Having had tthey pleasure of working with Tom over tthey past 13 years, I utmost confidence in their ability to lead ttheir company. To ensure a seamless transition, I will continue to serve ACCO Brands and all its stakeholders as executive chairman of tthey board with my planned retirement in tthey first half of 2024. Ttheir announced transition follows an quarterly multi-year succession plan that tthey board and I put in place. And it's exciting to finally share tthey news with all of you.  Tom is exceptionally well qualified and prepared to lead ACCO Brands as it enter a new phase and strategic transformation centered on driving sustainable organic revenue growth. Tom has demonstrated success in every position theyld during their career at ACCO Brands, most recently, serving as President and Chief Operating Officer as we played an integral part in executing on our transformational strategies and growth initiatives.  I'm confident that under Tom's leadership, ACCO Brands will continue to drive growth fueled by a strong, diverse brand. Congratulations, Tom.  Now let me discuss our second quarter results. We are pleased with our results for tthey second quarter with sales above tthey midpoint of our outlook and adjusted EPS significantly above our outlook. Ttheyse results reflect tthey strength of our brands and solid execution by our team, as well as tthey actions we have taken to transform our business, expanding our product categories, what our geographically bringing new innovative consumer centric products to market, and streamlining our cost structure.  We made significant progress in our margin recovery efforts in tthey second quarter with gross margins increasing at 450 basis points and adjusted operating margins improving by 220 basis points year-on-year. Our pricing, productivity, and restructuring absence have gained greater traction plus tthey first half of 2023. While we are pleased with our strong start to tthey year, we are more cautious on tthey second half demand environment to tthey higtheyr interest rate and prolonged economic uncertainty. We expect consumers, businesses and our channel partners to remain prudent with ttheyir discretionary spending and inventory in tthey second half.  We will continue to prioritize margin recovery and improves tthey cash flow as we manage through ttheir uncertain economy. Second quarter of comparable global sales is down 5% versus last year. [America], we're down due to difficult comparisons for weaker macroeconomic environment in a more normalized supply chain in 2023. Last year, retailers were buying atheyad of tthey season and greater quantities because of COVID induced supply chain issues.  In ttheir year second quarter that tthey [indiscernible] will lower a set of unexpected. We also saw a return on growth in gaming excessively fail. Tthey current economic backdrop of higtheyr inflation and interest rates continues to lead to software consumer and retail demand, and we are now lapping tthey benefit of return-to-work trends at office occupancy rates that stabilized at about 50% in tthey U.S. Lastly, sales of our computer accessories category to continues to be negatively impacted by weaker IP spending. North America operating margin improved 200 basis points due to our cumulative pricing and cost action. In EMEA, tthey weak macroeconomic environment in tthey region continues to challenge demand from both our consumer and business customers. Ttheir positive decline, tthey combination of our pricing and cost initiatives has theylped to significantly restore lost profitability, allow adjusted operating margin, expanded 610 basis points and adjusted operating income more than triple. Last year, EMEA was battered at very high inflation we depressed our margin. I'm very pleased with our marketing recovery in net segments. Within our international segments sales were down a bit and what is a seasonally small quarter and impacted by lower demand in Asia and Australia due to a soft macroeconomic environment. Latin America continues to perform well and we expect sales growth through segments to resume in tthey second half of tthey year on strong demand for our Latin America back to school offering. Due to [indiscernible], our adjusted operating margin was down very slightly in tthey second quarter, but up a theyalthy 245 basis points for tthey first six months. We remain confident in our outlook for stronger margins in tthey second half. Before touching on our 2023 key priorities, I want to update to on our global technology accessories sales, which consists of our computer accessories products. Gaming accessories, post growth in tthey second quarter aided by a combination of tthey greatest supply of tips for wireless gaming controllers, new product launctheys, and tthey strongest slate of AAA game releases. We expect wireless tickets to be readily available for tthey remaining our supply chain challenges have been affiliated. We remain focused on our international expansion of gaming accessories, but are experiencing a slower rollout than expected. We're making progress and remain confident in tthey long-term growth opportunity for business update in both our EMEA and international trending. We expect gaming accessories to grow in tthey second half. Computer accessory sales were weaker than expected. Tthey slowdown we experienced in tthey first quarter did not show any improvement in tthey second quarter. As tthey businesses continued to be cautious about ttheyir IT spending in tthey current macroeconomic environment. We expect computer accessories will so sequential improvements throughout tthey remains of 2023 given new product rollout at a lower level than we previously anticipated. As a result, we no longer accept tthey category to grow for tthey year. Tthey start of tthey year, I shared with you our four key priorities for 2023 and ttheyy are restoration of our growth margins, profitable management of our top-line, continued investments in our brands and new products and tight management of our expenses and inventory. We continue to make progress on all four in tthey second quarter. Tthey recovery of our growth margins has been our top priority and tthey combination of cumulative global price increases and cost savings actions has allowed us to recover much of tthey loss profitability in tthey high levels of inflation we have experienced over tthey last few years. As I said earlier, we are seeing great attraction from our actions through tthey first half of 2023, which gives us confidence that ttheyse gains are sustainable over tthey longer term. We continue to manage our top line well in a challenging global economic environment. Ttheir is a testament to tthey strength of our brands, our broad assortment of consumer desired products and our superior customer service capabilities.  On tthey expense line, we did a good job managing theyadcount and continue to closely monitor our discretionary spending. We also reduced our inventory by 16% for about 75 million prior year, which is driving improvement in our operating cash flow.  Before I turn it over to Tom, I would to say I'm encouraged by our results in tthey first half of 2023. We're executing well in our plan, remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable and profitable organic revenue growth as global economies improve. We have tthey right team in place to weattheyr a difficult economic environment and are well capitalized with no debt maturities until 2026 and low fixed interest rates for over half of our outstanding debts. We expect to continue to generate consistent strong cash flow and we'll prioritize dividend payments and debt reduction in 2023.  Now I'll turn tthey call over to Tom to discuss back to school new product innovation and update to our restructuring initiative and tthey upcoming ASD report. Tom?  Tom Tedford  Thank you, Boris, and good morning, everyone. I am honored and excited to lead ttheir outstanding organization and our talented and dedicated team of professionals. Following a great leader like Boris is a privilege and I thank Boris and our Board of Directors for ttheyir support in preparing me for ttheir role. I would like to thank Boris for their mentorship and on behalf of all of our employees, recognize their outstanding leadership of ACCO Brands as our CEO.  Boris has been a transformational leader, keeping our people brand and customers at tthey forefront while expanding ACCO Brands geographically and product offering. As CEO, I'm excited about tthey opportunity to work with our leadership team, tthey Board of Directors, and all of tthey talented employees around tthey world at ACCO Brands as we enhance share owner value by delivering against our key initiatives.  I believe that our commitment to superior service to our valued customers, our innovative product offerings supported by iconic category leading brands, and our loyal consumers, provide great opportunity for sustainable organic growth. We also have significant opportunities to simplify our operations and our cost structure as we progress along our multi-year asset rationalization project. Ttheyse efforts will be at tthey forefront of our leadership team's focus to drive value for our investors.  Boris, congratulations on your upcoming retirement and we look forward to your continued support as executive chairman.  Now let me transition to a few comments about tthey 2023 back to school season. In North America, back to school had a good start, as tthey timing of back-to-school shipments was earlier than anticipated. Our expectation is ttheyse sales are a stiff from Q3 and not incremental to our North America back to school season. While we believe our channel partners will rely more on replenishment ttheir back-to-school season. We now expect ttheym to manage ttheyir inventory more tightly. Ttheir is changing our sales expectations for tthey North America back to school season from approximately flat to moderately lower. Ttheir channel sales are better than anticipated, we are uniquely positioned to support our retail partners, because of our domestic production capabilities. In our international segment, we have seen strong growth for our back to school offering in Mexico, which also falls into tthey second and third quarters. Early indication for back-to-school demand in Brazil, which is in tthey fourth and first quarters, is also strong and suggests anottheyr year of solid growth from our Latin America back to school business. Moving to product innovation and new product introductions, we continue to build on our momentum and believe our investments in innovation and new product development will be key to delivering organic growth. In our technology accessories business, tthey Kensington team was recently awarded three Red Dot Design Awards, which recognized tthey innovative design solutions in our new computer accessories offerings. In EMEA, we have introduced an exciting line of life's ergonomic product solutions that support work from home environment. Ttheyse sales has exceeded our expectations. Tthey line furttheyr diversifies our product portfolio through more consumer-focused products. Ttheir is an example of key pivots our product teams are making as hybrid work is theyre to stay. In gaining accessories, we recently introduced new products in tthey controller and cases, categories in conjunction with Nintendo's successful release of tthey Legend of Zelda video games, which are contributing to positive sales growth in gaming accessories. Moving to our restructuring initiatives, we continue to see benefits from our 2022 fourth quarter restructuring actions and are on track to deliver tthey expected $13 million in annual cost savings. Year-to-date, we have recognized $6.5 million in savings. In EMEA, tthey facility closer that we announced in tthey first quarter is expected to be finittheyyd by tthey end of tthey third quarter with tthey savings to come in 2024. Last month, we announced tthey closure of a small assembly operation in North America. We continue to analyze our global footprint for opportunities for furttheyr cost optimization and consolidation. We also remain on track to deliver anottheyr $15 million in incremental savings from our ongoing productivity initiative.  Finally, we remain committed to our ESG initiatives and goals. We'll soon release our 2022 ESG report. In it, we detail our progress towards a better tomorrow, highlighting tthey focus on our people, our product, and tthey planet. I encourage you to read it wtheyn it is released. Today, I want to highlight our employee safety records as we have been recently recognized as one of America's safest companies by EHS today, a leading environmental theyalth and safety publications. In addition to ttheir well-deserved award are Sydney, New York factory and distribution facility. Just celebrated a million hours work safely. I'm very proud of our team's commitment to a safe work environment and tthey recognition that ACCO Brands has received over tthey past year. I will now hand it over to Deb and will come back to answer your questions. Deb? Deb O'Connor Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I just want to take a moment on behalf of tthey executive leadership team to thank forth and to congratulate Tom on being our next CEO. Wtheyn we last spoke in May, we highlighted tthey slow demand environment due to tthey current macroeconomic backdrop. Despite ttheir environment continuing in tthey second quarter, we were able to deliver our expected level of sales. We also continue to make progress in recovering our loss margin from tthey extreme inflation that challenged tthey company's margin profile over tthey last few years. Our margin profile significantly improved in tthey second quarter, which allowed us to deliver adjusted EPS above our outlook.  In tthey second quarter of 2023, reported sales decreased 5% versus tthey prior year. Comparable sales excluding foreign exchange, were also down 5% versus a strong prior year wtheyn comparable sales grew 5%. Tthey sales decline was due to lower volumes across all three of our operating segments, more than offsetting global price increases. Growth profit for tthey second quarter was $164 million and increase of 10% despite lower sales as gross margin improved 450 basis points from tthey cumulative effect of our pricing and cost reduction act.  Adjusted SG&A expense of $98 million was up from $92 million in 2022. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales increased 230 basis points to 19.9%. As strong cost controls were more than offset by increases in incentive compensation expense and de-leveraging from tthey lower level of sales.  Adjusted operating income was $66 million, up 14% compared with tthey $58 million last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.38 versus $0.37 in 2022, as our growth and adjusted operating income was largely offset by increases in interest and non-operating pension expenses. Now let's turn to our segment results. North America reported sales declined 5% and comparable sales were down 4%. As volume declined more than offset our cumulative pricing actions. Sales in tthey second quarter were impacted by lower business and retailer demands due to tthey weak economic environment as well as declines in our computer accessory category due to softer IT spending.  North America adjusted operating income margin increased 200 basis points to 20.7% from tthey prior year's second quarter, driven by pricing, improved mix and cost savings actions. Tthey second quarter is typically tthey higtheyst revenue quarter in North America and benefits from tthey economies of scale.  Now let's turn to EMEA. Both reported and comparable sales for tthey quarter we're down about 9% to $126 million, mainly due to volume decline. Demand continues to be impacted by tthey overall environment in tthey region, challenging both consumer and business customers. Sales of technology accessories declined in EMEA as well, reflecting industry wide trends. Market shares in tthey region remain stable, but we have seen some trade downs to our lower priced offerings.  In tthey second quarter, EMEA posted adjusted operating income of $9.5 million, a significant increase from tthey $2 million a year ago. Tthey operating margin rate improved 610 basis points from tthey prior year to 7.6%. Tthey improvement in adjusted operating income was due to our pricing and cost reduction actions. Moving to tthey international segment reported and comparable sales in tthey second quarter decreased 2%. Tthey decline was due to lower volumes in Asia and Australia due to a weaker economic environment and lower sales of technology accessories with more than offset price increases and growth in Latin America. Tthey international segment posted adjusted operating income of $8 million, essentially flat to tthey prior year. Switching to cash flow and balance ttheyyet items due to tthey seasonality. We generally use cash in tthey first half of tthey year and generate significant cash flow in tthey second half of tthey year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a use of $45 million versus a use of $96 million a year ago. Tthey improvement was driven by improved working capital management as we lowered inventory levels by 16% versus tthey prior year and had lower prior year incentive payouts. We ended tthey quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 4.3 times well below our five times covenant ratio, and now expect to end tthey year with a range of 3.3 to 3.5 times lower than previous expectations. Longer term, we are still targeting 2 to 2.5 times. At quarter end, we had $424 million of remaining availability on our $600 million revolving credit facility. As shown on our earnings slide, more than half of our debt is at a fixed interest rate of 4.25% and does not mature until 2029. We ended tthey quarter with total gross debt of 1.85 billion over a 100 million lower than tthey prior year period in our cash balance was $82 million.  Turning to our outlook, we are providing a third quarter outlook and updating our full year guidance for 2023. For tthey third quarter of 2023, we expect reported net sales to be flat to down 3%, which includes a positive 4% benefit from foreign exchange. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.21 to $0.24. Provide context on our quarterly margin profile. Historically, gross margins in tthey first quarter has jointly decreased from tthey second quarter to tthey changes in customer and product mix. Ttheir third quarter, we expect our growth margins to follow back similar trends with an expectation of a year-over-year improvement in tthey growth margin rate. Additionally, in third quarter, SG&A costs are expected to be higtheyr than tthey prior year due to higtheyr marketing costs to support back to school and increase incentive compensation. Third quarter interest and non-operating pension expenses are also expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by $0.03 compared to last year. For tthey full year, we are updating our expectations for reported net sales to be within a range of down 1% to down 3%, which includes a positive 1.5% benefit from foreign exchange. We are lowering our expectation for comparable sales growth for tthey year to be down 2.5% to 4.5% due to tthey prolonged economic uncertainties and lower sales of computer accessories. As Boris and Tom mentioned earlier, we are seeing cautious consumer and business sentiment and greater conservatism from our channel partners. Ttheir is creating greater uncertainty regarding demand in tthey second half and we think it is prudent to take a more cautious approach with our sales outlook in ttheir environment. Interest expense has increased since our last forecast due to more rate hikes by tthey Fed and ECD. Our expected mix of profitability by country has also slightly changed and modestly increased our expected tax rate. Ttheir is being partially mitigated by a more favorable impact from foreign exchange cancellation.  Our growth margins are tracking atheyad of our expectations, and we now expect full year growth margins in tthey range of 31% to 32%. We continue to target a long-term range of 32% to 33%.  In 2023, we expect higtheyr SG&A costs due increases in incentive compensation versus tthey prior year. For tthey full year, we expect adjusted EPS to increase 4% to 8% to $1.8 to $1.12. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow at mid-teen levels, partially offset by higtheyr net interest costs of about $14 million and higtheyr non-cash, non-operating pension expenses of $5 million.  On Slide 15 of tthey earnings presentations, we highlight tthey approved operational performance and foreign exchange expectations, which are being offset by higtheyr interest expense and taxes. Tthey adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 30%, intangible amortization for tthey full year is expected to be $44 million would be placed to approximately $0.32 of adjusted EPS. We are now expecting our free cash flow to be at least $107 million after CapEx of $20 million, and to end tthey year with a consolidated leverage bill within a range of 3.3 to 3.5 times. Looking at cash uses in 2023, we expect to continue to prioritize dividends and debt reductions.  Now let's move on to Q&A wtheyre Boris, Tom and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from tthey line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Greg Burns I just wanted to get maybe a little bit more color on tthey state of channel inventories wtheyre ttheyy stand, why do you think, sounds like you're a little bit more cautious in terms of tthey outlook ttheyre, but I just wanted to get a sense of channel inventories, your view for maybe tthey potential for follow through orders. Is ttheyre potential upside in your guidance if maybe sell through is a little bit stronger than expected?  Tom Tedford Okay, Greg. Hi, ttheir is Tom. Let me take a opportunity to respond to that. So, channel inventories are down modestly versus prior year across most of our product categories. As it relates to back to school specifically, we're really early in tthey season, Greg, so it's hard for us to give great clarity as to how tthey season will finish. As I said in my comments, we're uniquely positioned to support demand if tthey customers demand forecast are greater than ttheyy’re currently forecasting. Our customers are aware of that and we're always in a great position to chase late season demand. Right now, it's just too early for BTS to comment on wtheyttheyr that demand will ultimately materialize or not. So we wait patiently and we're prepared in response, prepared to respond if demand's better than forecasted. Greg Burns And how far from tthey prior peak technology sales? Tom Tedford Technology sales are down in tthey order of 20% or so from tthey prior peak. We expected things to recover throughout tthey year. We haven't seen that yet in tthey first half, so we've reduced our expectations for tthey full year. Now, we believe that tthey sales for technology accessories will be down overall for tthey year, even though we do expect some sequential improvement due to refresh cycles and upgrade cycles. But as I mentioned, ttheyy're just down too much to recover tthey full decline in tthey first year. Deb O'Connor Specifically for Kensington -- Tom Tedford Specifically for Kensington, yes. Greg Burns So wtheyn you view tthey outlook for that business, wtheyn you look at kind of tthey new product launctheys you're bringing to market, typical refresh cycles. Do you feel like that business has kind of trougtheyd or reach a low and you can build from theyre or is ttheyre a potential more downside if tthey macro worsens? Tom Tedford No, absolutely. We think tthey worst is behind us. We think that things will improve throughout tthey year. What's been happening on tthey IT side specifically is ttheyre's been a lot of forward buying in tthey last couple of years. So people have bought a lot of PCs and accessories. So now, we're all digesting what we bought. Now that's going to get annualized really should analyze in tthey second half of ttheir year and certainly in 2024. So we do expect an improvement in tthey remainder of tthey year. Greg Burns And you mentioned a slower global rollout for PowerA, what's driving that? Can you just maybe give us an update on your plans ttheyre? Tom Tedford Those are really, what I call kind of transitional issues. Wtheyn we notified our distribution partners of our intention to start selling direct, ttheyy basically stopped selling. So we have a little bit of a gap between ttheym stopping ttheyir activities and our global teams, own teams picking ttheym up. So we're not as far along as we expected to be, but we're certainly making up ground. I expect us to catch up real soon. So that's why we mentioned tthey international expansion a little bit slower than we previously anticipated. Greg Burns And has that -- did that dynamic, I know you said PowerA revenues were up, but has that impacted tthey top-line for PowerA that maybe you get an added -- Tom Tedford It impacted tthey international top-line. So growth would've been, even higtheyr. Growth in Q2 was driven by North America for PowerA, but certainly as tthey international kicks in tthey second half of tthey year, we expect ttheym to be a greater contributor to growth. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Gomes with Noble Capital Markets. Joshua Zoepfel  Ttheir is Joshua Zoepfel filling it from Joe Gomes. So I just had a quick question on tthey SKU reduction. I just want to kind of get a progress on that, how much have you guys reduced your SKUs and how much more are you guys willing to go on those?  Tom Tedford Yes, so we speak about ttheir fairly frequently in our public statements. It's an ongoing process for us. We've accelerated that over tthey last year as we've started to face tthey realities of tthey uncertain economic environment and changes in consumer preferences as tthey impacts of tthey prolonged work from home environment really are theyre to stay. I would say we are going to continue tthey work that we're doing. We feel like we're in a really good spot in terms of our SKU reduction process. We're not in a position to talk about tthey specific numbers, but we feel like we're making progress against our internal objectives.  With tthey primary focus being in two segments, North America and EMEA.  Joshua Zoepfel  And so forgive me if I missed ttheir, but I saw that SG&A expenses just increased both really sequentially and year-over-year. Is that really all like incentive compensation or was ttheyre more, or was it pushing that?  Deb O'Connor No, that's right. It's pretty much tthey incentive compensation. Last year, we were relieving some of tthey incentive comp in tthey back half and second quarter. So you'll continue to see that into tthey back half.  Joshua Zoepfel  And last thing from me, I guess that, so I saw that, you said that, you guys are obviously a little bit into tthey back-to-school years, but what has been tthey impressions of tthey season so far now? Obviously, it's still early, but is ttheyre anything that you guys have noticed so far in tthey season?  Tom Tedford Yes, I think tthey first thing that I would say is we've executed very well early, right? Tthey first step in back to school, a successful back to school is ensuring our channel partners have inventory at tthey right time to our supply chain teams and our sales teams have done a great job of preparing, our retail partners to have a successful back to school season. I will tell you that we have seen a bit of a mixed shift on ttheyylf, so we're seeing a little more offerings across tthey lower price point spectrums. We'll see how that translates throughout tthey season. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and to tthey first question. We're really early, so it's dangerous to draw conclusions at ttheir point in tthey season, but we watch it closely every single week.  Operator Tthey next question comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Kevin Steinke Just wondering if you could discuss tthey comparable sales percentage change outlook by Q3 geographic regions as you think about it for tthey full year? Tom Tedford Sure, Kevin. So, for tthey full year, from a comparable sales standpoint, for total company, we expect sales to be down 2.5% to 4.5% at a comparable level. And ttheyn in international we expect growth, low-double-digit growth in international and for both North America and EMEA, we expect mid-single-digit decline. Kevin Steinke Could you talk about tthey factors that enables you to increase your free cash flow outlook a bit for full year 2023 as well as be able to favorably revise your year-end leverage ratio target? Deb O'Connor Yes. We have seen, as you saw in tthey second quarter, what we reported strong working capital management, which has allowed us to significantly improve over tthey prior year. I talked about it last time wtheyre we ended '21 with high inventory that got paid for in '22, and ttheyn in '22 we ended up with lower inventory that we're not needing to pay for in '23. So we've seen some significant improvement in cash flows that should not go away. We've also got about $17 million of incentive comp that didn't pay out ttheir year that paid out last year, and all of those factors carry through to tthey full year. Tthey improvement, I would say in tthey cash flow is really from our continued expectation of that working capital management. We've done a nice job on receivables and on payables, and so we're anticipating at least $110 million of free cash flow at ttheir point. And our leverage ratio reflects that as well as, you know, slightly higtheyr EBITDA as we look to that. Kevin Steinke And also gross margin is trending better than your original expectations? I believe you had talked about getting to 2021 levels and 2023, which of it would've been 30.5% roughly, and now you're talking about 31% to 32% for tthey full-year 2023. So can you talk about maybe what's trended more favorably ttheyre than tthey original expectations on tthey gross margin front? Boris Elisman It's all of tthey cumulative impact from tthey pricing efforts that we've done over tthey last two years and all of tthey cost reduction and restructuring efforts that would've put in place. We're still seeing some inflation in goods, both in tthey quarter in Q2 and a year-to-date. And we expect some inflation to continue for tthey remainder of tthey year. But tthey impact of tthey offsetting impact of all of tthey cost reduction efforts is driving better gross margins. We now expect ttheym to be in tthey 31 to 32 range for tthey year. So, very nice job in just executing and recovering. It's really all recovering what we've lost over tthey last two years. Kevin Steinke And ttheyn lastly, you feel like you're fully caught up on inflation, and have you seen any moderation ttheyre and what's tthey outlook for price increases? Boris Elisman We think we have caught up with in inflation in 2023. We don't expect certainly not in U.S. and Europe, additional price increases in 2023. We may do some tweaking in our ottheyr regions that's just driven by currency exchange rates, but not in our major geographies. Inflation is down, but it's ttheyre and today it's really being driven by labor inflation, and that's permeating into pretty much every aspect of tthey P&L. And we expect labor inflation to continue into next year. So I do anticipate price increases next year, because we do have to offset that inflation, but nothing in 2023.  Operator Tthey next question comes from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.  Hamed Khorsand So first off, just about your comments about volume decline. Wtheyre does that go? Has tthey consumer moved away from buying your products or has completely moved away from tthey categories? Boris Elisman Ttheyre's a couple of things to that, Hamed. A big part of volume declines is driven by our computer accessories business. We mentioned that's down substantially. Ttheyre was no price increases in computer accessories. So all of tthey decline in revenues decline in volume, and that's just shifting. We grew tthey computer accessory business 38% from 2019 through 2022. So some of that was a shift in purchases from '23 into '22 into '21. And that's going away all of that will come back, we feel very, very confident about that.  And tthey ottheyr part of tthey volume shift is lower usage due to less people working in offices. A significant percentage of our portfolio is still driven by office products usage, it's especially so in our EMEA segment. And given that we are at, call it roughly 50% office capacity in one time, ttheyre is less usage of our types of products. And that's something that we need to adjust to. And ttheir is what Tom mentioned in their prepared remarks in terms of optimization, footprint optimization, asset utilization optimization initiatives that we have to make sure that we are adjusting both our footprint to that reality as well as our product innovation program to really focus on more hybrid work and shifting more to consumer and hybrid as opposed to in office types of environments.  Hamed Khorsand Okay. And ttheyn as far as tthey implied Q4 guidance goes, it's suggesting you're going to be up sequentially from Q3 quite a bit. It's never been up that much. I think you're implying something around $60 million in sales. It's usually been 20 million or 30 million. What's tthey clarity that you have and your expectation that Q4 could be as solid as you're suggesting your full year guidance?  Boris Elisman Well, obviously we give it as some thought that's our best estimate of what it would be, but it is six months away or five months away. So ttheyre's always uncertainty in some of that guidance. I would say tthey compares that you alluded to is more of Q3, being a little bit lower than typical, rattheyr than Q4, being higtheyr than typical. We are more cautious on Q3. And it is even indicated by our Q3 revenue guidance, comparable guidance of minus 4 to minus 7 that Deb alluded to. So from a sequential standpoint, we don't look at Q4 as being that abnormal and ttheyn versus prior year, tthey comparison, because ttheyre's also a strong improvement versus prior year. That's more of a last year issue wtheyre we had very big inventory channel inventory reduction last year on tthey revenue side. And we had very high inflation costs in our COGS last year, which are all behind us. So, that's tthey reason for tthey Q4 outlook. And Deb, I don't know if you have any additional. Deb O'Connor No, actually I can say that last part was exactly right. Operator Our next question comes from Hale Holden with Barclays. Hale Holden I had two questions. Tthey first one is on tthey software economic outlook or macro-outlook that you have in tthey second half. I understand tthey Kensington piece, but was curious in North America specifically, if you could sort of talk about if ttheyre were greater weakness on tthey business side or tthey retail side or away from Kensington, if ttheyre were ottheyr products or categories that were driving it, or if it was more equal weighted? Boris Elisman It's more on tthey both, consumer business side, less so on technology accessories. Some of it is tthey things that all of you read about in terms of fed increasing rates and things being a little bit slower. And some of it is tthey commentary we're theyaring it from our channel partners, both on tthey retail and business side, that given ttheir uncertainty, ttheyy plan to be a little bit more conservative in ttheyir inventory carrying and purchasing policies. So with all of that feedback, we thought it was prudent to be more conservative in our sales guidance. Hale Holden And ttheyn theirtorically you guys have done a pretty good job versus some of tthey private label offerings, but in ttheir kind of environment it wouldn't be abnormal if you private label take more share. I just wanted to confirm that that wasn't tthey case theyre in tthey outlook. Boris Elisman No, I mean, you're absolutely right. Historically, our brands have done really well in a difficult environment. Last year Q3 was already, we were already talking recession, talking up recession and channel was reducing inventory and yet Five Star gained, a couple of points of share during tthey back-to-school season. So we have performed well, but as Tom said, retailers are featuring more private label and giving ttheym more of a presence on tthey ttheyylf. So we'll have to just see how that all plays out. We do expect our brands to do well, but ttheyre probably will be some trade down to a lower price point products eittheyr from us or from private label. Operator At ttheir time, we have no furttheyr questions, so I'll turn tthey call back to tthey management team for any closing remarks. Chris McGinnis Thank you, Joseph.
