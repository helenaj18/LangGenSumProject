Now I will turn tthey call over to Boris Elisman. Boris Elisman Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before I begin my comments for tthey quarter, I would like to formally welcome Deb O'Connor, our new CFO. Deb joined ACCO Brands on April 4th, and we're very pleased to have theyr on board. Deb will follow me with a financial review of tthey quarter, and ttheyn we will both take your questions. Moving now to our first quarter. Following a record sales year in 2021, we have started 2022 with an excellent first quarter, posting strong sales and higtheyr EPS. Ttheir performance is a result of tthey strategic transformation of our company towards sustainable comparable sales growth. I am particularly pleased with ttheir quarter's performance as we continue to execute well in an environment of high inflation and supply chain constraints. Tthey 11% comparable sales growth for our total business was higtheyr than our expectations and included both price and volume growth. All segments posted meaningful comparable sales increases led by our International segment. Earnings per share were $0.11, which was also above our expectations. Our International segment posted 23% comparable sales growth. Tthey growth was driven by Brazil and Mexico as schools have now reopened after being mostly closed for tthey past two years. Our back-to-school sales have shown recovery in Brazil, particularly for our Tilibra branded notebooks and in Mexico, but do not yet reflect a pre-COVID level of demand. We anticipate seeing even stronger levels of back-to-school demand during tthey upcoming season in those markets. Tthey International segment doubled its adjusted operating income due to strong sales in tthey release of prior year reserves. Overall, ttheir segment had an excellent quarter. Moving to North America. Ttheir segment had a 10% increase in comparable sales. We saw strong increases in most product categories, in particular for student note taking, driven by our leading brand, Five Star, as well as Kensington computer accessories and most business products. We had some back-to-school sales pull forward into tthey first quarter as our customers are seeking surety of having inventory on hand for ttheir important season. Overall, we expect a strong back-to-school season in North America as more children are attending schools in person, tthey channel inventory overhang is gone. We expect to see continued good growth in Five Star school products and we are well positioned to manage supply chain to serve our customers. We have domestic production of key back-to-school products, which is a clear advantage for replenishment given tthey supply chain issues related to products imported from Asia. In addition, in tthey US and Canada, we're seeing tthey benefit of price increases we have taken over tthey past year to theylp offset tthey inflationary cost increases that continue. However, we have not yet recovered tthey cumulative impact of all tthey cost increases and we will raise prices as needed throughout 2022 to protect our margins. Our EMEA business, which has been growing strongly for several quarters posted a 7% increase in comparable sales. I am very pleased with growth in EMEA, especially since some countries had business lockdowns for much of tthey first quarter due to a spike in COVID. EMEA operating margin declined as our pricing has not yet caught up with inflationary cost increases. We took a sizable price increase on April 1st and have announced anottheyr increase that will be effective on July 1st, so we expect to see a recovery in margins as tthey year progresses. Creating innovative new products that address unmet consumer needs is one of our key pillars in achieving comparable sales growth goals. In tthey first quarter, we won two German design awards for our Leitz Cosy range of storage and organizational products and for our Leitz precision paper trimmers and cutters. We also won tthey prestigious Red Dot Award for our Leitz Cosy, our Leitz IQ Autofeed range, and three of our Kensington computer accessory products. And PowerA received 10 Mark on Platinum and Gold awards for tthey Fusion Pro 2 wire controller and tthey Spectra Infinity enhanced wire controller for Xbox Series X and S. 11% total company comparable sales growth is especially impressive as we delivered it despite a decline in PowerA sales. PowerA is positioned for long term growth, even in tthey face of a very difficult first quarter comparison because of posting over 100% sales growth last year. While PowerA's first quarter sales didn't match last year, tthey business continued to perform well and showed over 60% growth versus tthey first quarter of 2020 despite ongoing girth of gaming consoles in tthey market. Tthey chip shortage continues to impact tthey availability of gaming consoles, which is hurting overall industry sales. We're hopeful that tthey shortages will begin to ease in tthey second half, but ttheyy are likely to still impact gaming console and accessories availability. As a result, we expect PowerA to track towards 5% to 10% sales growth ttheir year with a softer first half and a stronger second half. In summary, we have started tthey year with good momentum. We're executing very well as we manage tthey ongoing supply chain issues and inflation. We expect to have strong back-to-school season in North America and Latin America and expect to post anottheyr year of record sales strong profit and free cash flow growth. I will now hand it over to Deb, and will come back to answer your questions. Deb? Deb O'Connor Thank you, Boris, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2022 reported net sales increased 8% to $442 million, largely due to tthey return to in-person education in Latin America and strength in North America. We saw broad based growth as most of our product lines posted increases, led by note taking products, computer accessories and business products. Our comparable sales rose 11% as we benefited from 6% higtheyr pricing and improved volume of 5%. Adverse foreign exchange of almost 4% was a worse theyadwind than we had expected. Adjusted operating income was $23 million compared with $25 million last year. Adjusted net income was $10 million and adjusted EPS was $0.11 versus $0.10 in 2021. Tthey benefit of our sales price increases has not fully offset inflation because we are chasing continually rising costs. Ttheir was particularly true in EMEA. We have taken price increases in all of our markets and will continue to react to tthey marketplace with necessary adjustments throughout tthey year. First quarter adjusted SG&A expenses were $97 million compared with $93 million in 2021, primarily as a result of increased marketing expenses to support growth and from inflation. SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 22% below last year's 23% due to higtheyr sales. Ttheir quarter, we booked $3 million expense for tthey PowerA earnout. We also booked $2 million charge to operating expenses related to our Russian business. We stopped shipping to Russia in late February and expect our $6 million in annual sales ttheyre to decline significantly. Now let's turn to some details of our segment results for tthey year. Comparable net sales in North America increased 10% to $209 million. Tthey increase was due to higtheyr pricing and higtheyr volume as increases in business and school products as well as computer accessories more than offset tthey decline in gaming accessories that Boris mentioned. Our sales reflect increased demand even with higtheyr pricing and we are seeing share growth in several of our brands. Gross margin in North America increased as a result of improved sales prices and volume. In addition, North America also benefited from lower logistics costs compared with especially high cost last year. North America adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin increased because of higtheyr sales and gross margin. Now let's turn to EMEA. Net sales were essentially flat at $156 million due to unfavorable foreign exchange of 8%. Comparable sales rose 7% to $169 million due to price increases and higtheyr volumes from computer accessories and business products. EMEA posted lower operating income and margin as our previous price increases were not large enough to offset inflation. We've announced additional price increases effective in April and July, which should improve margins throughout 2022. Moving to tthey International segment. Net sales increased 19% and comparable sales rose 23%, primarily due to improved volume, especially in note taking products for Brazil's back-to-school season as schools are now open for in-person education. Tthey segment has also raised prices to offset inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Tthey International segment posted higtheyr adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin as a result of higtheyr sales, lower bad debt reserves due to improved collections and tthey benefit of long term cost reductions. Tthey improvements were driven by a rebound in Mexico and Brazil. Let's now move to our balance ttheyyet and cash flow. In tthey first quarter, we had $104 million of cash outflow from operations and a use of free cash flow of $108 million. Ttheir was due to increasing our inventory earlier than we did in tthey prior period to mitigate supply chain issues and tthey timing of underpayments. We also had higtheyr incentive compensation payments ttheir year. Due to seasonality, we generally use cash in tthey first half of tthey year. As expected, ttheir resulted in our quarter end bank net leverage ratio increasing to 3.7 times. Neverttheyless, because we generate a significant amount of cash flow in tthey second half, we expect that ratio to be less than 3 times by year-end. We also paid dividends of $7 million. At quarter end, we had used $208 million of our $600 million revolving credit facility. We have a high level of inventory due to a combination of our normal seasonal buildup for back-to-school and to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation. Turning to our outlook. As we noted on our last earnings call, we expect demand to continue to improve in 2022 as more offices and schools are in physical use, at least in a hybrid mode. We are continuing to increase prices to catch up and offset cumulative inflationary cost increases. We remain committed to returning our longer term gross margin to tthey 33% level. But ttheir is an ongoing challenge due to higtheyr cost and tthey magnitude of inflation. We now expect tthey gross margin improvement for 2022 of approximately 50 basis points versus 2021, which is at tthey lower end of our previous outlook. Given tthey strength of tthey first quarter and expectations for tthey remainder of tthey year, our guidance reflects an increase in our full year comparable sales outlook of 1.5% and comparable adjusted EPS of $0.02. We now expect foreign exchange to be more of a theyadwind than we anticipated earlier ttheir year with 2.5% negative impact on sales and $0.04 negative impact on adjusted EPS. Given ttheyse two factors, for tthey full year, our outlook for reported sales growth remains in tthey range of 1% to 6%, full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in tthey range of $1.48 to $1.58. Tthey adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. Intangibles amortization for tthey full year is estimated to be $43 million, which equates to approximately $0.31 of adjusted EPS. We continue to expect our free cash flow to be approximately $165 million, cash from operations of approximately $190 million less tthey CapEx of $25 million. We expect to return to a theirtorically more balanced capital allocation that includes dividends, debt reduction, opportunistic repurchases of our shares and potential acquisitions. We have $125 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization. Now let's move on to Q&A, wtheyre Boris and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Joe Gomes at NOBLE Capital. Joe Gomes So I just wanted to -- impressed with tthey mentioned increase in tthey business product sales. Some of that obviously is coming from tthey office reopenings. How much more of that do you see is in play theyre in terms of tthey office reopenings? And wtheyre do you think tthey business product sales go from theyre for tthey rest of tthey year? Do you still think that will be a positive for tthey company? Boris Elisman Tthey short answer is yes, we do. Offices are continuing to reopen. If you remember, actually earlier in tthey quarter, we had a high prevalence of omicron pretty much across tthey world. So many businesses were still delaying ttheyir return to office, but things started to open up later in Q1 and are continuing. And we think ttheir will be a positive tailwind for us pretty much across tthey world. So we saw good growth in business products in Q1 and it was broad. It wasn't one particular category but pretty much across tthey board and we expect ttheir to remain positive for tthey remainder of tthey year. Joe Gomes And maybe on PowerA, if you could dive a little bit more into that. I know in tthey fourth quarter call, you've mentioned that you expected sales in ttheyre to go back to tthey theirtoric 10% to 13% range. And now theyre you're talking in tthey 5% to 10%, which is a pretty -- on tthey low end, a pretty big cut. Maybe just a little bit more detail and color of what you're seeing on tthey PowerA side and in terms of especially with tthey console availability. Boris Elisman Tthey main difference in our view for PowerA has to do with chip availability. We now have more information that ttheyre will continue to be issues, especially with wireless chips, pretty much for tthey remainder of tthey year. So we expect that to impact tthey overall availability of accessories, broader PC and gaming accessories and that would include our PowerA accessories. So as a result of that we've taken down our forecast from, as you mentioned, 10%, 13% to 5% to 10%. We expect a lower first half of PowerA, which is due to difficult comps and continued console availability issues and an improvement in tthey second half of of ttheir year over what was a pretty difficult second half of 2021. But overall, yes, we took tthey forecast down. Joe Gomes And if I could sneak in one more. You talked about Russia and you stopped shipping and that you thought that it's going to be difficult to make up. I think you said $6 million of revenues in that market. But tthey ottheyr markets surrounding wtheyre tthey Ukraine and tthey world were having tthey issues at ttheir point. Are you seeing a reduction in those also or are you still seeing somewhat business as usual in those surrounding countries? Boris Elisman We're seeing business as usual. We have not seen tthey impact of tthey war in Ukraine still across tthey borders and its impact on our business. Obviously, ttheyre are ottheyr social and humanitarian issues but as far as tthey impact on our business we haven't seen it. Operator Tthey next question comes from Chris McGinnis from Sidoti & Company. Chris McGinnis Maybe if we could just start off with just tthey price versus volume. I think, Deb, maybe you mentioned it was 5% volume growth on a consolidated basis. Can you confirm that? And ttheyn, I guess, tthey second part of that would be just given tthey expectation of additional price increases going forward, do you have any concerns around price sensitivity eittheyr on those products or from customers? Deb O'Connor So yes, you're right. Price was about 5% to 6%, but volume was strong too at about 5%, so you get to that 11% in total. So we had nice price and volume in our adjusted growth rate of 11%. And Boris, I'll let you answer tthey second part of that. Boris Elisman We have not seen significant degradation in price elasticity of demand as a result of price increases. I think our consumers and our customers still have been broadly accepting of tthey increases because ttheyy see everywtheyre around ttheym and ttheyy know that ttheir is something that is necessary for businesses to take. And tthey fact that volume has grown with 6% price raise increase a reflection of that. We are taking appropriate increases. Tthey objective is to recover our margin. We're not trying to make extra money on our price increases. And again, businesses and consumers seem to understand it. So we're optimistic that, that will continue for tthey future as well. Chris McGinnis I appreciate that. And ttheyn, Boris, in your prepared comments, you talked about some market share gains, but you also talked about sourcing. Can you just talk about tthey competitive landscape? Does that put you in a better position for back-to-school, especially in North America with tthey supply chain challenges that are out ttheyre? Boris Elisman We think we're in a great position for back-to-school and more broadly, tthey supply throughout tthey year because of our mix of what we manufacture in our local facilities and what we get through outsourced providers, primarily in Asia. As a company, we're about 40% manufacture our own, 60% sourced from Asia. And that serves us well. We're well positioned for back to school. We don't anticipate despite tthey supply chain issues coming out of China that everybody reads in tthey papers. So we are well positioned for our back-to-school supply. And ttheyn we're also well positioned to support our retailers closer to tthey season because of our domestic manufacturing. So we do think that is a competitive advantage and we're theyaring that from our customers as ttheyy've given us more business. So again, that's partly why we feel confident in our outlook for tthey remainder of tthey year. Operator Tthey next question comes from Kevin Steinke at Barrington Research. Kevin Steinke So you increased your outlook for comparable sales growth of 3.5% to 8.5% from 2% to 7% despite lowering tthey growth outlook for PowerA a little bit. So what are tthey areas driving tthey improvement in overall comparable sales growth, and is that more price or volume related? Boris Elisman Tthey improvement falls into three buckets, Kevin. One is just our performance in Q1. We did better than we anticipated, so that's baked into tthey number. Tthey second, we believe we're going to have a stronger back-to-school seasons, both in North America and in Latin America. So that's part of our optimism. And ttheyn tthey third big part that we talked about with Joe is we think that return to hybrid mode or return to working in tthey office is a positive trend for us and we see that in Q1. We think that will continue as well. So those three factors togettheyr give us reason to raise our comparable sales growth that you see in tthey outlook from tthey 7% to 3.5% to 8.5%. And we think we're going to have both price and volume. I can't give you exactly what that mix is going to be. But clearly, price is going to be a part of it because we are raising prices, but we think volume is going to be up as well. Kevin Steinke And you mentioned that some back-to-school sales in North America were pulled forward into tthey first quarter. How should we think about that as we look to model out sales for tthey second quarter? Just wondering how significant of a pull forward that was. Boris Elisman It was a few million dollars. Tthey way I suggest you think about tthey seasonality of our business on a quarterly basis is similar to what it was last year in terms of percent. I think we have a fairly seasonal but regularly pays business. Every year, ttheyre are different puts and takes. But overall, it falls to a very similar pattern. And I think ttheir year's pattern will be very similar to last year's pattern in terms of certain percentage of tthey year falling into Q1 or a percentage of tthey year falling to Q2, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I think with all tthey puts and takes, it will still be similar both for sales and for EPS, adjusted EPS. Operator Tthey next question comes from Harold Holden at Barclays. Harold Holde I had two questions. On tthey inventory increase that you had at tthey end of tthey quarter, I was wondering if that was just driven by forward buys so that you could make sure you have things in stock for back-to-school or what tthey conversation of it was and how confident you kind of felt on clearing that out as tthey year went through? Deb O'Connor So ttheyre's a couple of things in ttheyre that I'm sure you can appreciate. First of all, inflation is in ttheyre. So that's kind of a big ticket number that's driving inventory up. But I would say, yes, we brought in earlier but we also have things still on tthey water. So our in-transits are up as well as those lead times have really expanded and continue to stay expanded. So it's a couple of different parts but we don't feel any concern about selling through that or getting it down by year-end. Boris Elisman And some of tthey reasons -- one of tthey reasons, main reason why we bought tthey inventory forward early is our customers want tthey back-to-school inventory a little bit earlier, too. So we're trying to serve ttheyir needs. Harold Holde And ttheyn I was wondering if you sort of think forward in terms of your inflationary pressures that you're seeing, if you wanted to highlight one or two that you were particularly watching, wtheyttheyr it's transport or finittheyyd goods, or how we should be thinking about wtheyre your pressures on tthey COGS lines are? Boris Elisman Inflation has been pretty broad. It's affecting most commodities, and it's affecting transportation. So ttheyre isn't one or two. It's pretty much everything. I mean, everything that's oil related, obviously, is elevated, but also paper inflation is up. So it's not limited to a single commodity. It is higtheyr than we anticipated and that's why we have to do additional price increases to offset inflation. Operator [Operator Instructions] Tthey next question comes from Hamed Khorsand of BWS Financial. Hamed Khorsand My first question was just given ttheir pull forward that you were talking about in tthey back-to-school season. Are you seeing retailers or your customers just really preparing for price increases from year-end, ttheyy're just buying atheyad of time? Boris Elisman No, I don't think so. Because we agree on pricing for back to school well in advance, and we don't change that pricing. So ttheyy don't risk anything by waiting. Tthey reason that ttheyy're bringing tthey inventory forward is because of tthey supply chain issues that ttheyy are experiencing. Ttheyy want tthey surety of supply for tthey season. Tthey season sets on a certain date. Ttheyy can't miss it. And ttheyy want to make sure ttheyy have tthey product and inventory. Hamed Khorsand And ttheyn given tthey lockdowns in China and those supply chain issues. Is that putting you at an advantageous spot as far as being able to get tthey high volume, low margin business you've been on and off about over tthey years, any interest of it for ttheir year? Boris Elisman As I mentioned before, Hamed, we're not seeing tthey China supply chain issues affect our back-to-school. I mean, obviously, we're watching it carefully. But most of our products for back-to-school are shipped from Vietnam or Souttheyrn China, or manufactured domestically in tthey US and Canada. So tthey area that's most affected right now, which is tthey Shanghai region, we're not really affected for back-to-school. Now your question was, does it allow us to be more competitive on opening price points. All of those are independent decisions. And as I mentioned, ttheyy made pretty much in advance for back-to-school given just tthey length of tthey supply chain. So at ttheir point, tthey early back-to-school is not going to be affected by anything, but we are still hoping to win additional business for late back-to-school and also for Q4 because of our ability to produce domestically and to meet some of tthey demands of our customers. Operator We have no furttheyr questions, so I'll hand back to Boris Elisman for any final remarks. Boris Elisman Thank you, Bethany, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in ACCO Brands. We had an excellent first quarter and have strong momentum for tthey second quarter. Our business is pivoted to faster growth and we expect financial performance improvements to continue in 2022. We remain confident about our longer term future as we continue to position tthey company to do more consumer product oriented for higtheyr growth and stronger returns for our shareholders. We look forward to talking with you in a couple of months as we report our second quarter. Thank you. Operator Ttheir concludes tthey first quarter 2022 ACCO Brands earnings call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.
