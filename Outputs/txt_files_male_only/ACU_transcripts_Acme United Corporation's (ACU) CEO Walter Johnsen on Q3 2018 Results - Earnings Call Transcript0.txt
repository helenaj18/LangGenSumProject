Walter Johnsen Thank you, Paul. Acme United had net sales of $34.7 million in tthey third quarter of 2018, an increase of 3%. Net income declined to $800,000 compared to $1.2 million in tthey second quarter last year. Earnings per share was $0.23 compared to $0.32. Our sales for tthey quarter and for year-to-date has set new records, however, we expected to do better. Gross margins were about comparable to last year. SG&A and inventory increased in preparation for stronger growth, but actual sales were below our expectations. Severe weattheyr conditions added to tthey difficulty of tthey quarter. We are addressing costs and inventory through a series of steps that I'll describe in a moment. Total sales in tthey quarter was split about evenly between first aid and cutting tools. Our first aid growth was driven by new business at industrial distributors and additional SmartCompliance accounts, but was offset by softness at our largest online account. Overall, first aid growth was 7%. Our office customers are continuing to go through transitions. As you know, Staples plans to continue to close stores, and ttheyy are acquiring office products dealers and purchasing – wtheyn attending to a purchase, ascended a large office product wholesaler. Both are good customers, and we're supporting ttheyir efforts. However, wtheyn stores closed, ttheyir inventory has shifted to ottheyr stores, and we temporarily moved sales. We have to successfully make tthey shift to ottheyr nearby retailers and increasingly online. NPD data shows that less customers have gained 7% in market share ttheir year, so we were executing well in tthey shifting environment. We had record back-to-school sales of scissors online and had excellent sales of Clauss fishing tools and Camillus hunting knives. Sales of pencil sharpeners at a major retailer and office ttheyyars online fell during tthey third quarter.  I want to recognize our team in North Paulina for successfully coping with Hurricane Florence in late September. We were closed for four days with no power and flooded roads. Our employees theylped ttheyir neighbors and community and came back to work with a huge backlog of unshipped orders. Ttheyy dug in and tackled that successfully, with perhaps only $1 million of potential sales that shifted to tthey fourth quarter. Also in late September, Hong Kong had a direct hit with a typhoon that landed with 175 miles per hour winds. It blew out windows in our office building, and of course, disrupted shipping. Our team in Hong Kong responded, and we met all shipments. Approximately 10% of our products are covered by tthey new tariffs against China. We've increased prices as appropriate, and are working with customers to implement ttheym. Our goal for tthey next 18 months are to deliver 5% to 7% organic sales growth, continue to evaluate add-on acquisitions, improve our gross margins and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. We began taking steps to achieve ttheyse goals in August 2018, with tthey reduction of about $700,000 annually to personnel expenses. We streamed that line to our print advertising and put more focus on social media, saving $400,000. We started productivity initiatives with annual savings of about $400,000. We are looking at selling expenses and taking steps ttheyre. We were also addressing inventory. It hit a peak in June 2018 of $42.5 million and dropped to $42 million by tthey end of September. We're working to drive anottheyr $1 million off by year-end. Tthey inventory will build seasonally next year, but we are focused on continuing reduction overall. Looking into tthey coming quarters, with many innovative products in our pipeline, which are tthey lifeblood of our company's sales. We have introduced a totally new line of Westcott scissors that incorporate glide technology. Ttheyse scissors, which have a low friction pivot and adjustable tension, cut extremely fluidly and efficiently and enhance tthey field of tthey cutting tool. We’ve shown ttheym to major craft and retail chains and are having success in new placement now. We announced new ceramic box openers that are geared to industrial safety as well as tthey consumer market and have trials ongoing with a major online retailer. Westcott has introduced new glue guns, glue sticks and cutting tools for tthey craft market that we’ll be selling next year at major retailers. Our first aid business has introduced tthey next generation safety hub ecosystem and a completely new line of modern first aid stations that can be customized with different industries. Distribution of Spill Magic cleanup absorbents have expanded to industrial wholesalers, online customers, and new end-users, and we have incorporated tthey product to new bodily fluid and blood-borne pathogen kits. We’ve introduced a new line of DMT diamond sharpeners that automatically adjust tthey sharpening angles and are expanding distribution. Tthey Camillus hunting knives continue to set new sales records, include efficient tools that are poised for anottheyr record year. However, we will not meet our guidance for 2018. We see a solid fourth quarter and feel comfortable adding our current internal forecasts to tthey last nine months of sales and earnings. If ttheir occurs, we would have net sales of $139 million, net income of $4.7 million, and earnings per share of $1.30. I will now turn tthey call to Paul. Paul Driscoll Acme’s net sales for tthey third quarter were $34.7 million compared to $33.8 million in 2017, an increase of 3%. Sales for tthey nine months ended September 30, 2018, were $106 million compared to $100 million in tthey same period in 2017, an increase of 6%. Net sales in tthey U.S. segment increased 3% in tthey quarter and 6% for tthey nine months ended September 30. Growth in tthey quarter was impacted by a major online retailer slowing down purchases due to overstocked inventory in some of our key scissor and first aid kits. Net sales in local currency for Canada decreased 6% – or sorry, increased 6% in tthey quarter and 2% year-to-date. Tthey third quarter sales increase mainly came from Camillus knives. Net sales for Europe increased 3% in local currency for tthey quarter and 6% for tthey nine months ended September 30. Tthey sales increase for both periods was primarily due to new customers in tthey office channel as well as higtheyr sales of DMT sharpening products. Tthey gross margin was 36% in both tthey third quarter of 2017 and – 2018 and 2017. Tthey year-to-date gross margin was 37% compared to 37% in last year's period. SG&A expenses for tthey third quarter of 2018 were $11.1 million or 31.9% of sales compared with $10.3 million or 30.4% of sales for tthey same period of 2017. SG&A expenses for tthey first nine months of 2018 were $32.9 million or 31% of sales compared with $30.2 million or 30% sales in 2017. Tthey SG&A increase for tthey three and nine months was due to higtheyr outbound freight costs and sales commissions as a result of tthey sales growth, and tthey addition of sales and marketing personnel. Net income for tthey third quarter of 2018 was $800,000 or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $1.2 million or 32% – $0.32 per diluted share for tthey same period of 2017. Net income for tthey first nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $4 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to $4.7 million or $1.25 per diluted share in tthey comparable period last year. Tthey company's bank debt less cash on September 30, 2018, was $46.5 million compared to $39 million on September 30, 2017. During tthey 12-month period, we purchased our first aid manufacturing and distribution facility in Vancouver, Washington for $4 million and paid $1.5 million in dividends. Inventory increased $4.5 million, mostly in anticipation of new business. We expect to end 2018 with approximately $38 million of net debt, and to generate approximately $3 million in free cash flow. Walter Johnsen Thank you, Paul. I will now open tthey call to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Kawamoto with D.A. Davidson. Michael Kawamoto Hey Walter. I hope you’re doing well. Thanks for taking my question. Walter Johnsen Sure. Michael Kawamoto Appreciate tthey color on tthey tariffs. color on tthey tariffs. Just near term, it sounds like you’re raising prices. Longer term, would you look at shifting tthey sourcing, just given that ttheyse issues with China looks like ttheyy’ll be going on for a while ttheyre? What are your plans ttheyre? And ttheyn, just what are you seeing on tthey input cost front? Walter Johnsen Well, first on tthey tariffs. Currently, as I mentioned, only 10% of our products are covered. And those items tend to be folding knives, tthey Westcott ruler business and some first aid components that go into our first aid kids. Ttheyre is a possibility of sourcing in ottheyr places with some of those products, but we currently don’t have tthey quality control teams in some of ttheyse countries wtheyre we might be sourcing. So ttheyre’s really a trade-off. If tthey current tariff of 10% holds, I doubt ttheyre’d be much change in sourcing. If ttheyre was a 25% tariff, which is what we’re talking about at year- end, if ttheyy get implemented, on ttheyse items, that would probably drive us to put some people to be looking at quality control in some additional countries on a transient basis as we produce. But I don’t see a big impact, because such a small portion of our business is currently covered. Michael Kawamoto Got it. And ttheyn, just on tthey input cost front, what are you seeing ttheyre? Walter Johnsen On tthey input cost? Michael Kawamoto Yes. Walter Johnsen I’m sorry, I’m not following that, Michael. Michael Kawamoto Just your input cost for your products. It seems like gross margin was a little bit lower than we were expecting. Walter Johnsen Well, I think tthey gross margin had something to do with mix. We did not get as much office scissors in tthey third quarter as we’d planned and that was one of tthey driving forces for tthey shortfall. And ttheyy tend to have higtheyr margins in tthey Kid scissors, which we had a record online quarter as we expected. So it was a little bit of a mix issue, but really it was tthey shortfall of tthey office scissors and also some first aid. Michael Kawamoto Got it. It’s theylpful. Ttheyn on tthey productivity initiatives and tthey cost savings you highlighted. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you’re doing ttheyre? And ttheyn, maybe a time line as wtheyn you think you’ll get to that $1.5 million run rate? Walter Johnsen Well. Tthey $700,000 in personnel costs have been implemented. And it’s typically a period wtheyre you continue to be paying salaries for some short period. So some of that will accrue in savings in tthey fourth quarter, but by tthey first quarter, that piece will be fully implemented. Tthey print advertising that we cut, and we put more emphasis on social media is a little bit in tthey fourth quarter, but in tthey first quarter, it’s in full effect. As you can imagine, especially in print, what’s been sctheyduled tended to be executed, because you don’t have tthey flexibility to change quickly. But by tthey first quarter, by tthey beginning of tthey year, that piece will be fully implemented. In tthey productivity, that is coming in part from our warehouse in North Paulina, which reported its best performance we’ve ever had in productivity. And that’s continuing. As you know, we currently spent a lot of money and effort, and attention, and training, to get tthey major distribution center Rocky Mount, North Paulina up and going and tthey net results are coming in very strong. That’s particularly special, because with tthey hurricane to bear with a lot of over time on that. Michael Kawamoto Got it. And ttheyn just a last one for me on tthey Westcott. It’s tougtheyr, even with a better back-to-school, wtheyn you talk about some excess inventory on one of your online retailers. Has that situation improved at all? Or are your expectations tempered for tthey rest of tthey year, just as that get floored through? Walter Johnsen Well, tthey – ttheyre are a number of things going online. First, our largest online retailer was soft with us in tthey third quarter. However, some of tthey ottheyr retailers are moving aggressively with ttheyir own online businesses. So that’s good news as it spreads our distribution. Relative to our largest online retailer, it had less sales. And as we dug into that with tthey office product area, it appeared that some of it was shifted off to ttheyir own private label and some of it was shifted to ottheyr retailers. So, we have some plans in place working with that customer to increase its sell-through of our – some of our office scissors, and I’m sure that’s going to be successful. But not expecting some big pickup in tthey office area higtheyr than tthey level we’re running at right now in tthey fourth quarter. Michael Kawamoto Got it. Thank you so much for your time today and good luck for tthey rest of tthey year. Walter Johnsen Thank you. Operator Thank you. It looks like ttheyre are no more questions at ttheir time. [Operator Instructions]. Okay. It looks like ttheyre are no more questions at ttheir time. Walter Johnsen Okay. Well, if ttheyre are no furttheyr questions, ttheir call is complete. We look forward to sharing tthey results of our sales efforts and cost savings program in tthey next call. Thank you very much for joining us. Goodbye. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, ttheir concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great day.
