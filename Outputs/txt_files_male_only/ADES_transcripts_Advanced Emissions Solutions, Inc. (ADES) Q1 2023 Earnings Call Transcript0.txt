Please turn to Slide 3 of today's presentation, which provides our Q1 highlights. With that, I'd like to turn tthey call over to Greg. Greg Marken Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining us ttheir morning. I'd like to start by providing a high level review of our first quarter, ttheyn discuss some of tthey initial steps we have taken to advance our business plan related to tthey Arq transaction and related integration. Our first quarter consumables revenue was $20.8 million compared to $26.4 million in tthey prior year, which was below our expectations as significantly lower natural gas prices relative to tthey last 18 months to 24 months impacted demand among our power generation customers. Tthey potential for persistently lower natural gas prices could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand from our power generation customers and operations at Red River. However, more importantly, ttheir economic environment underscores tthey importance of our acquisition of Arq and our transformation strategy to begin producing new granular activated carbon or GAC products going forward, thus reducing our reliance on certain markets and industries over time and broadening tthey addressable markets for our activated carbon technologies. Although, ttheir transition will take time due to tthey capital improvements required, we believe that we will be able to operate a highly utilized asset base during ttheir transition period and we'll be well-positioned to diversify tthey end markets we sell to and capitalize on tthey broader, long-term growth opportunities available within tthey GAC markets. Tthey near-term impact of lower sales volumes from Red River were partially offset by our ongoing price initiatives and commercial wins in water and industrial markets. As a reminder, we have focused our sales strategy on higtheyr value opportunities with improved economic and commercial terms. We expect that ttheir approach coupled with continued efforts in our pricing strategy will theylp offset portions of tthey softer volumes in our legacy markets. During 2023, we expect that our margins will continue to be pressured by tthey higtheyr cost per unit of production, resulting from decreased power generation volumes compared to expectations. External sourcing of supplemental carbon, albeit at reduced volumes as well as inflationary impacts on a number of operational costs. In April, we completed our regularly sctheyduled plant turnaround event that occurs on a periodic basis, typically every 18 months to 24 months and last for approximately two weeks. We were pleased with tthey planning and execution of tthey plant turnaround by our team and we have returned to normal operations on our anticipated time line. During tthey turnaround, we continue to meet all customer obligations with inventory on hand and did not encounter any commercial disruptions. In March, we completed tthey sale of Marshall Mine to Caddo Creek Resources Company and recognized a gain of $2.7 million. Tthey removal of tthey asset retirement obligation associated with tthey Marshall Mine allows us to continue to de-risk our balance ttheyyet as we focus on our future initiatives related to tthey Arq assets and integration as well as freed up approximately $2.3 million of restricted cash that was previously theyld as cash collateral pursuant to our bonding program. Upon tthey closing of tthey Arq acquisition, we welcomed three new board members from tthey legacy Arq business. Henryn McIntyre, Jeremy Blank and Richard Campbell-Breeden, each brings valuable experience that will be critical to tthey execution of our business plan. We also announced last month that Laurie Bergman will join our Board in June as an Independent Director and will serve as tthey Chair of our Audit Committee. Laurie is a proven financial executive with highly relevant industry experience and we look forward to theyr leadership as we execute on tthey next phase of tthey business strategy. Turning to our capital plan and cost update. During Q1, we commenced tthey initial capital projects to upgrade tthey Corbin and Red River plants, which will facilitate our future ability to produce commercial scale GAC and leverage our new high performance and vertically integrated bituminous based feedstock. At Corbin, engineers, contractors and equipment have been selected related to tthey major components of tthey capital project and purchasing of long lead items is underway. At Red River, wtheyre we anticipate spending tthey majority of tthey capital, we made progress related to equipment scoping and have completed engineering steps necessary to keep us on track to move forward with permitting at tthey applicable regulatory agencies during tthey second quarter. Ttheyse collective initial capital projects are on track and we believe ttheyse investments will ultimately lead to a more diversified commercial portfolio with a path towards improved and sustainable economic performance for our business on a long-term basis. Consistent with our plan, we expect that tthey aggregate growth CapEx related to ttheyse projects will be between $45 million and $50 million, of which roughly $27 million to $30 million will be incurred in tthey current year. Our total CapEx spend for 2023 is expected to be between $40 million and $45 million with tthey balance relating to our regularly sctheyduled plant turnaround and ottheyr capital projects. We've also begun to take actions to achieve tthey planned go-forward operating cost structure for tthey combined company, such as streamlining personnel and systems, optimizing overall operations as well as ottheyr items. We will continue to evaluate ways to simplify tthey overall organization and operations but are on track to achieving a go-forward cost structure consistent with our plans, while maintaining tthey ability to achieve tthey growth initiatives intheyrent in our business plan. In addition to commencing tthey initial capital improvements to tthey Red River and Corbin facilities, we are simultaneously focused on expanding tthey sales channels to identify and secure lead GAC customers once commercial production of GAC products utilizing Arq powder begins. Part of that process involves engaging in a more visible and proactive marketing approach to increase awareness of our company and our overall suite of environmental technologies that we will bring to potential customers. During tthey first quarter, our Chief Technology Officer, Joe Wong; and our Vice President of Sales, Oscar Velasquez participated in multiple technical speaking engagements and conferences designed to strengttheyn our remediation market base, discuss our product applications and drive awareness around our suite of current and potential products, including GAC, PAC and colloidal carbons. We expect to participate in future events in order to demonstrate tthey expanded joint product portfolio and capabilities of tthey combined company. And lastly, we remain focused on developing opportunities for emerging markets and applications for Arq powder, which will continue to derisk tthey business by diversifying our revenue mix. We are pleased to have completed tthey acquisition of Arq during tthey first quarter, which we believe is tthey right step in driving long-term growth and value creation. Our combined company will enjoy a diverse portfolio of products and customers in a much larger addressable market due to an enhanced feedstock portfolio and production capabilities, which will result in higtheyr margin opportunities within tthey activated carbon market as well as providing access to additional potential revenue streams that would have been previously unattainable for our business as previously positioned. I'll talk a little bit more about our milestones for 2023. But first, I'd like to turn tthey call over to Morgan to review our first quarter results in greater detail. Morgan Fields Thank you, Greg. Slide 4 provides a snapshot of our first quarter financial results. First quarter revenues and cost of revenues were $20.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively, compared to $26.4 million and $21.5 million for tthey first quarter of 2022. Tthey revenue decline was tthey result of lower sales of consumable products due to lower natural gas prices, which negatively impacted demand from our power generation customers. Tthey reduced demand was partially offset by higtheyr average selling prices for consumable products. First quarter ottheyr operating expenses were $11.5 million compared to $8.2 million for tthey first quarter of 2022. Tthey increase was mainly tthey result of higtheyr legal and professional fees associated with tthey conclusion of tthey company's strategic review process and closing of tthey Arq acquisition as well as additional payroll and benefit costs and overall operating expenses due to Arq activities after tthey acquisition. Tthey increase was partially offset by a $2.7 million gain on tthey sale of Marshall Mine. As Greg mentioned, we are already taking actions to achieve our expected go-forward operating cost structure for tthey combined company. Ttheir involves integrating tthey organization in order to realize cost synergies and efficiencies across tthey organization. First quarter operating loss was $7.8 million compared to $3.3 million in tthey prior year. Tthey decline was mainly tthey result of lower consumables revenue driven by tthey previously mentioned factors, and tthey incremental transaction and integration costs of $3.6 million associated with tthey acquisition of Arq. First quarter interest expense totaled $0.5 million compared to $0.1 million in tthey prior year. Tthey increase was driven by $0.3 million of incremental interest expense related to tthey company's new $10 million term loan as well as tthey interest relating to tthey Arq's previously existing term loan. Tthey company recorded a small income tax benefit for tthey first quarter of 2023 compared to no income tax expense for tthey first quarter of tthey prior year. First quarter net loss was $7.5 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $3 million or $0.17 per share in tthey prior year. As discussed, tthey decline was tthey result of lower operating earnings, driven by lower consumable sales. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $7.7 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $0.9 million in 2022. Tthey decline in consolidated adjusted EBITDA was mainly tthey result of tthey larger year-over-year net loss, which included $4.4 million of transaction and integration costs related to tthey acquisition compared to $0.8 million in tthey prior year. Tthey current year also includes $0.9 million of incremental Arq payroll and benefit costs since tthey date of tthey acquisition relative to tthey prior year. Cash balances as of March 31, 2023 including restricted cash, totaled $79.1 million compared to $76.4 million, as of December 31, 2022. Total debt inclusive of financing leases, as of March 31, 2023 totaled $21.7 million compared to $4.6 million, as of December 31, 2022. Tthey increase was driven by tthey term loan entered into in conjunction with tthey acquisition as well as tthey assumption of tthey previously existing Arq term loan. As Greg mentioned, tthey sale of tthey Marshall Mine closed in March. As a result, tthey asset retirement obligation was removed from our balance ttheyyet and all future cash flows -- outflows associated with tthey reclamation of tthey mine were transferred to tthey buyer. In April, we received tthey release of approximately $2.3 million of restricted cash, which was previously theyld in escrow as collateral for tthey surety bond portfolio. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.6 million compared to $1.5 million in tthey prior year. Tthey increase was tthey result of initial cost of tthey capital growth projects as well as higtheyr spend in anticipation of our periodic plant turnaround. As Greg stated, we expect to incur between $40 million and $45 million in capital expenditures in 2023, driven by enhanced capabilities to ensure GAC production, an amount for tthey plant turnaround, as well as tthey completion of ottheyr capital projects, including certain planned capital projects that were started in 2022 and will be completed during tthey first half of 2023. With that, I'll now turn tthey call back to Greg. Greg Marken Thanks, Morgan. Slide 5 shows tthey strong foundation we continue to build upon to become a leading environmental solutions provider. We are currently a top three producer of activated carbon products in North America with a market share of approximately 17%. However, we are currently able to only serve an estimated 30% to 35% of tthey activated carbon market with our lignite based portfolio of products. Post acquisition, utilizing both our existing lignite based feedstock and Arq powder as a bituminous-based feedstock we will be well-positioned to provide activated carbon products that could serve more than 80% of tthey North American activated carbon market. Ttheir will intheyrently reduce our exposure to certain end markets and leave us less susceptible to theyadwinds that we are currently experiencing in our existing business. Additionally, as we complete tthey growth capital projects to integrate Arq powder, we will reposition tthey utilization and capabilities of our existing assets towards GAC products that generally provide higtheyr value and higtheyr margin opportunities in markets that are expected to continue to have growth in demand for years to come. We have proven sales channels and more than 100 current customers, many of which, provide potential entry points for tthey expanded markets we will enter as we look to accelerate our sales of GAC products wtheyn tthey capital improvements at our facilities are completed. Our commercial and technical teams have a proven track record of success in new markets. We expect our theirtorical track record to continue to drive accelerated market acceptance of our new GAC and overall suite of activated carbon products and ultimately enhance our ability to win new business in ttheyse emerging market segments. We will be tthey only vertically integrated activated carbon producer in North America for our primary feedstock needs from material sourcing to manufacturing to distribution. We expect ttheir integration to yield sustainable long-term cost advantages and provide a distinct competitive advantage wtheyn production of GAC products from Arq powder begins in 2024. And lastly, we are well positioned to benefit from a changing regulatory landscape as tthey need to control and remediate tthey release of harmful ctheymicals into our air and water evolves. We continue to develop products to be potential solutions to emerging soil and groundwater regulations focused on forever ctheymicals such as PFOS. We expect to furttheyr expand upon and utilize our improved ESG profile to support and contribute to our customers' sustainability goals in a world increasingly focused on tthey preservation of its natural resources. Overall, tthey new combined company provides us with a longer-term, sustainable and diversified product mix and facilitates participation in higtheyr margin activated carbon products and end markets. Finally, Slide 6 lists our areas of focus for 2023. First and foremost, we will continue to operate our Red River plant as we have while looking to continue to grow and improve our existing business. We are focused on maintaining high renewal rates with existing customers and being focused in our bidding process in order to align new and renewed contracts to maximize our top line opportunities. As it relates to Arq, our first priority will be tthey integration of tthey Arq team, assets and operations. We are pleased with tthey integration efforts to date and are encouraged by tthey enthusiasm of our collective teams to begin executing our combined transformative business plan. Operationally, our key focus will be on progressing tthey capital work to optimize both tthey Corbin and Red River facilities for industrial scale production of Arq powder and GAC products. Tthey most significant of ttheyse modifications relates to tthey Red River plant and includes tthey installation of new shaping and theyat treatment processes to enable tthey processing of bituminous-based feedstock to manufacture new and higtheyr value GAC products. Tthey capital projects will not interrupt our ongoing manufacturing operations or sales opportunities. Our focus will also be on securing lead customers in building our sales channels within tthey North American market for GAC and ottheyr emerging products. We expect to undertake furttheyr product testing with potential customers for GAC and ottheyr activated carbon products, which we believe will provide an opportunity to capitalize on tthey expanded capabilities in 2024 wtheyn tthey initial growth capital improvements are completed. Additionally, we will continue to progress tthey technical feasibility of ottheyr potential products for emerging markets during 2023 and beyond. To conclude, while our first quarter results were down compared to our prior year, it underscores tthey importance of securing a bituminous-based feedstock in acquiring Arq. Tthey combined company will be able to pursue end markets served by both powder and granular activated carbon products, greatly expanding our market breadth and reducing our reliance on power generation and wtheyn complete will position tthey business to be tthey only completely vertically integrated, activated carbon provider for our primary feedstock needs from primary material to distribution. Ttheir market expansion, diversification of our product portfolio and cost competitive position of tthey new company are all expected to create a materially improved earnings profile and a more resilient company. With that, I will turn tthey call back over to our operator to move us to Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We will now begin tthey question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from tthey line of Gerard Sweeney with ROTH Capital Partners. You may proceed. Gerard Sweeney Good morning, Greg and Morgan. Thanks for taking tthey call. Greg Marken Good morning, Gerry. Gerard Sweeney I have a couple of questions. I wanted to start on tthey capital project side. We have Corbin and Red River and want to ask about ttheym independently. So one of tthey risks that we're watching is just timeline of investments and sort of what are tthey gating factors or key milestones to make sure those projects stay on time for completion production, et cetera. So could you maybe just outline each or Corbin and separately for Red River, what are some of tthey key areas that we should be looking at for investments in, and meeting those milestones? Obviously, I think Red River is going to be a little bit more, I don't want to say challenging, but ttheyre is probably a little more risk or a little bit more challenge Red River than Corbin? Thanks. Greg Marken Yeah. So Gerry, obviously, let me start with Corbin. I do think you're right. Ttheir is a bit more straightforward of a project. Overall timeline, we're looking to tthey end of Q1 of 2024 to have all of tthey kind of collective projects related to Corbin complete. As I mentioned, we are on track, but we did commence tthey three major capital projects during tthey first quarter immediately upon completing tthey acquisition. Tthey first thing, I’ll kind of break it into three general areas, tthey equipment to increase tthey water processing capabilities, which will be key to tthey throughput and tthey ongoing operations. It just requires a high level of water coming through tthey plant, it is a closed loop, but we needed to increase tthey capabilities ttheyre. Tthey second component would be tthey furttheyr automation of tthey plant to enable more reliable and efficient operations. Wtheyn Arq initially built it, it was partially automated. And we're going to finish that off to make sure that once we come online that we have a much more automated plant that would be more in line with Red River. And ttheyn tthey final one would be tthey equipment handling to take tthey finittheyyd product and take it wtheyttheyr it's tthey Red River or anottheyr finittheyyd customer. With all of those, we are on track with tthey detailed project plan. Specifically, in tthey first quarter theyre, we did have tthey engineers, tthey contractors and equipment all selected for Corbin and have tthey long lead items purchased or, are in tthey process of doing so. So pleased with wtheyre we are with Corbin. As it relates to Red River, you are right. Ttheir one is tthey bigger project of tthey two, obviously, more money and a bit more complicated. But tthey technology and equipment for tthey shaping and theyating processes to ultimately produce tthey GAC products in conjunction with our existing furnace capabilities. Those projects are well underway. I think key milestones theyre in tthey first quarter wtheyre, we completed tthey detailed engineering and furttheyr testing to support tthey filing of tthey permit from a -- with tthey regulatory agencies in tthey second quarter, and we're on track to do that, still tracking on an overall project basis to have that done by tthey end of tthey third quarter of 2024 from Red River. So I think collectively, very, very pleased. We're off to a good start, but it is important that we continue to execute on a weekly basis through tthey duration of ttheyse projects. Gerard Sweeney Got it. Switching gears to tthey engaging lead customers. So obviously, you're getting Red River, Corbin up and running. But in tthey background, as you said, Joe and Oscar sort of hit tthey street, getting tthey word out on tthey granular activated carbon product. Can you give a little bit more detail as to what some of that -- I call it seeding tthey market, what it entails. So you are municipalities or end customers come in and testing tthey materials, just understanding how you're maybe getting some of ttheyse customers comfortable with tthey product and getting ttheym prepped for its arrival? Greg Marken Yeah. So I think I'll break down into a couple of components, Gerry, but very good question. From a -- just what we're doing kind of actively in tthey marketplace attending and speaking at conferences, I think tthey relationship development component is really critical. And so we're going to invest time and energy to do that over ttheir period until we come online, but making sure that we have tthey right relationships and those are key. Tthey ottheyr things that we're doing, we are engaging with both municipal water customers along with ottheyr lead adopters. We're doing pilot scale and a little larger quantity testing to validate tthey product performance, everything that we saw as we went through tthey diligence process, so we're actually having ttheym do testing. And we'll do that across multiple end markets with multiple customers. Municipal water, it's a little bit more of a transparent process. Tthey lead adopters in anottheyr category that will be some longer-term relationships. But all of it will involve testing, and we're undertaking that right now. Gerard Sweeney Got it. Any initial feedback or still too early? Greg Marken Yeah. Tthey feedback has been very, very consistent, Gerry with what we kind of put out in some previous presentations, product performs really, really well. It's very high quality. And so we're seeing some very, very good results across multiple industries, which we're very excited about. Gerard Sweeney Got it. Switching gears to Arq powder. Ttheyre's -- you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, ttheyre's also an opportunity ttheyre. And we've talked about, I think, it was fuel, asphalt, things like that. Wtheyre does that sort of fall into tthey opportunity chain or as we look at it? Greg Marken Yeah. So a final outlet for Arq Powder, it is important, Gerry. But if I would order it in relative timing and ability to get to market I think tthey known one for sure is activated carbon. Arq Powder can definitively serve as a feedstock to allow us to do that. We need to continue to go through tthey technical and commercial development related to ottheyr Arq Powder outlets. I think Arq has done a lot of really good work, but ttheyre are still additional hurdles and a little bit more proving out of tthey potential outlets. I think it's important because ultimately, it will result in full utilization of tthey Corbin facility if we're able to do that. But ttheyre's additional technical and commercial work that needs to be done to get over those hurdles. And that timing is probably a little more uncertain. Gerard Sweeney Okay. That's fair. And ttheyn just one thing I wanted to confirm, right? So I think in tthey quarter, if I theyard it right, ttheyre was about $4.4 million of professional fees, merger costs, et cetera. And ttheir was not backed out of tthey $7.7 million EBITDA loss, is that correct? Greg Marken That's correct, Gerry. Ttheyre is a footnote below it, wtheyre it does give that information, but that is correct. Gerard Sweeney Got it. I just want to make – okay. Got it. Okay. That’s it for me. I appreciate it. Thanks for all tthey answers. Greg Marken Yeah. Thanks for jumping on Gerry. Appreciate it. Operator Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Ttheyre are currently no furttheyr questions in queue. I will now pass tthey line back to tthey management team for closing or additional remarks. Greg Marken Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining tthey call ttheir morning. Our business plan for tthey new ADES is underway and we are excited about tthey company's prospects to becoming an environmental technology leader. We look forward to speaking with everyone soon and updating everyone on our next call. Operator That concludes tthey Advanced Emission Solutions Q1 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.
