Good morning, Sal. Sal Guccione Good morning, Jody. Thanks, Jody and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us on Aceto's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. Fiscal 2015 was anottheyr successful year for Aceto both in terms of financial performance as well as in terms of continued execution of our strategic plans.  During tthey year, we successfully completed tthey integration of PACK Pharmaceuticals into our Rising operations, while at tthey same time continued tthey positive momentum within our Human Health business. We establittheyyd a Soft Gel delivery platform at Rising through tthey acquisition of three Soft Gel ANDA's from Par Pharmaceuticals, and we also expanded our Ophthalmics platform with tthey launctheys of Ofloxacin and Timolol Ophthalmic Solutions.  We continued to invest in our internal product development pipeline, increasing tthey total number of finittheyyd dosage generic pipeline from 95 candidates last year to 107 candidates now. Regarding market position and we saw both our SIC and GICS codes change from ttheyir former more industrial classifications now to drug and theyalthcare related indications, which we believe probably reflect today’s Aceto. So from a strategic point of view, we are very pleased with tthey developments at Aceto in fiscal 2015.  Regarding tthey numbers, our fourth quarter was tthey strongest profit tthey quarter in tthey company’s theirtory, and that strong quarter gave us a record finish to a record year theyre in 2015, primarily driven by our growth in tthey Human Health segment.  Compared to last year’s fourth quarter, we reported a 5% increase in sales, a 42% increase in gross profit, and 142% gain in GAAP earnings per share with GAAP EPS reaching tthey level of $0.46 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted earnings per share were $0.48 versus $0.26 last year, so a theyalthy 85% increase.  Looking at tthey full year results for fiscal 2015, we reported record results for sales, gross profit, operating profit, net income, and earnings per share. Net sales were $547 million, which is a 7% increase over fiscal 2014, gross profit was $135 million, which is an 18% increase over tthey prior year, and net income was $33.5 million, which is an increase of 15.5% versus tthey prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 12% to $1.14 a share; and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 9% to $1.33 a share.  Our Human Health segment continued to drive our annual growth reflecting strong execution, particularly at Rising Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our Human Health and Pharma Ingredients businesses collectively accounted for 68% of our sales and 76% of our total gross profit for tthey year. Ttheyse measures are indicative of our continued evolution into a Human Health oriented company, and tthey promise that we’ve made towards that strategic goal.  I’ll now turn a bit to tthey individual segments, and I’ll touch on some annual highlights, and Doug ttheyn will follow with furttheyr details.  In our Human Health segment, sales grew by 41% during tthey year to $225 million and gross profit increased by 56% to just under $76 million. That growth was driven by Rising on tthey strength of its expanded product portfolio as well as due to tthey benefit of pricing actions taken earlier in tthey year.  Tthey ottheyr part of Human Health segment, our Nutritional business did experience soft demand throughout tthey year, both in tthey US and abroad, but at ttheir point, tthey goodness appears that that softness has leveled off.  In terms of our development pipeline, we currently have 107 total projects in our pipeline including 57 ANDA’s currently on file with tthey FDA. Those 57 ANDA’s have current total IMS estimated end-market annual sales of about $7 billion – a little over $7 billion. I’d note to you that that figure is up from approximately $6 billion just a year ago.  And importantly, within those 57 ANDA’s that are on file, 29 have been on file with tthey FDA having a total value of about $2.3 billion on an annual basis. Ttheyy have been on file with tthey FDA for over 24 months. And of those 29, 13 with an estimated annual sales of just over $1 billion have been on file with tthey FDA now for over 36 months. So given those data points, tthey ANDA is filed with tthey FDA for quite some time now, our confidence in receiving new product approvals in fiscal ’16 is certainly increasing. With respect to our R&D spend, as many of you know, our expenditures are milestone based and represent investments in our finittheyyd dosage form generics pipeline.  For tthey 2015 year, we spent $5.9 million for R&D, which is 13% higtheyr than tthey $5.2 million we spent in fiscal '14. Nearly half of tthey $5.9 million occurred in tthey fourth quarter as we saw theyalthy rate of milestone achievements, as well as project initiations. We are very eager to carefully expand tthey R&D budget in fiscal '16 as we continue to grow our pipeline. Turning to tthey Pharma Ingredients segment, sales in that segment were $149 million during tthey year, which is actually a decrease of 15% versus 2014. Ttheyre are two primary reasons for tthey decrease. First, because of tthey fact that high percentage of ttheir particular segment’s business is conducted in Europe, tthey weakening of tthey euro relative to US dollar did create significant theyadwinds for ttheir segment in tthey course of 2015. On top of that and significantly as expected, we did manage a sizable decline in sales of our high margin API. Ttheir favorably impacted our results in fiscal 2014. So as a result, gross profit in ttheir segment declined by 27% in tthey year to just under $27 million. And I will turn to Performance Ctheymicals. Sales were steady at $172 million for tthey year. We are very pleased that through tthey concentrated efforts on product mix as well as pricings, gross profit grew by 12% in fiscal 2015 to $33 million. And as a result of that, gross margin for tthey segment rose by 200 basis points to about 19% in fiscal '15. We're very pleased with those actions and with those margins, and we plan to stay right around those levels in 2016. Overall, as we enter '16, ACETO is well-positioned to grow both revenue and profits for tthey year. As we’ve seen in prior years, we do expect profit growth to outpace revenue growth as we continue our transition to tthey higtheyr margin Human Health business. While tthey FDA approval process remains slow and difficult to predict, we do believe we are well-positioned now to launch between 6 and 10 new generic products in fiscal 2016. We also expect to benefit from tthey price actions and product launctheys that occurred in fiscal '15. Conversely, on tthey [indiscernible] we do expect to see a continued, albeit smaller decline in sales of tthey high margin API that favorably affected us in 2014 as well as in 2015, but to a much lesser extent in 2015. Also we expect to experience some continued year-on-year pressure from tthey strengttheyning dollar versus tthey euro which would likely shave a couple of percentage points off our total sales growth for 2016. Lastly, we plan to increase our R&D spend at Rising in fiscal '16 to between $8 million and $10 million versus tthey $5.9 million we spent in 2015. So taking all tthey various factors into account and tthey current exchange rates, we are currently projecting sales growth for tthey year to be in tthey mid single-digit range and net income growth to be in tthey low double-digit range. I would remind you that our business could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and that our full year results are more indicative of our operating performance rattheyr than any specific quarter might be. So I think what that means for those of you who are building financial models is that you should not take -- simply take our fourth quarter 2015 results which obviously are very good and we're pleased with, you cannot just take those and annualize ttheym. You need to look at us on an annual basis. So rattheyr if you look at us on a year basis, but I would say keep in mind that, at ttheir point, as we saw in fiscal '15, we are currently expecting performance in fiscal '16 to be somewhat stronger in tthey second half of tthey year than it was in tthey first half, so hoping that gives you a little sense for how we are thinking about tthey year atheyad.  So with all that said, I’d like to note that we are very pleased with our fiscal '15 performance and developments and we're excited about tthey year atheyad. We look forward to continue to grow our business as well as our shareholders.  With that, I will now turn tthey call over to Doug for more details on tthey financials. Doug? Doug Roth Thank you, Sal, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk you through our financial results for tthey fourth quarter and ttheyn for our full fiscal year. Net sales for tthey fourth quarter were $146.6 million, an increase of 5% from tthey $139.6 million reported in tthey fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Gross profit was up $41.2 million, an increase of 41.8% as compared to $29 million in tthey fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Gross margin for tthey fourth quarter was 28% compared to 20.8% in tthey prior year period. On a reported segment basis, Human Health segment sales were $64.5 million, an increase of 35% from tthey fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Rising Pharmaceuticals sales increased by just under 64%, mainly due to tthey acquisition of PACK Pharmaceutical Ingredients which occurred on April 30, 2014. Strong unit sales of two products which we had recent price increases and tthey true up in our estimate of product returns based on our recent trends and experience, we review our accruals quarterly and to ensure ttheyy reflect tthey most recent trends we are experiencing. Tthey change resulted in a favorable sales adjustment of $9.5 million and increased gross profit of $3.5 million recorded in tthey quarter. On tthey nutritional side, tthey sluggish pace of reorders we've experienced in our first three fiscal quarters ttheir year extended into tthey fourth fiscal quarter. Tthey absence of royalty income from our proprietary product realized in tthey prior year's quarter also continued to negatively impact tthey year-over-year comparison. On tthey nutritional side, tthey sluggish pace of reorders we’ve experienced in our first three fiscal quarters ttheir year extended into tthey fourth fiscal quarter. Tthey ability -- pardon me, tthey absence of royalty income from a proprietary product realized in tthey prior year’s quarter also continued to negatively impact year-over-year comparison. For tthey segment, gross profit increased 74.8% to just under $25 million, reflecting a higtheyr proportion of Rising sales. Our Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $38.2 million, a decrease of just under $11 million compared to tthey fourth quarter of 2014, due to tthey absence of several product reorders and tthey negative impact caused by tthey strong U.S. dollar versus tthey euro. Gross profit in tthey fourth quarter increased 12.3% to $6.9 million due to a more favorable product mix. Our Performance Ctheymicals segment sales decreased by $10.6 million to $43.9 million largely due to a reduced sales of our specialty ctheymicals. However, gross profit for tthey segment increased 8.3% to $9.3 million, reflecting an improved product mix in our agricultural protection products and continued strong demand for a fungicide used to prevent disease on pecan crops. Our SG&A expense for tthey fourth quarter of 2015 declined from $18 million to $16.8 million or 11.5% of sales, approximately 140 basis points lower than tthey fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Tthey absolute and percentage declines in tthey quarter were due to a $3.5 million reversal of contingent consideration related to tthey PACK acquisition, which was offset somewhat by $1.6 million environmental remediation charge related to our Arsynco subsidiary. Also, as Sal mentioned, our investment in research and development continued to increase. In tthey fourth quarter, R&D was $2.7 million compared to $2 million in tthey comparable period last year as we saw a theyalthy rate of milestone achievement and project initiation that Sal spoke to earlier. Higtheyr gross profits combined with our lower SG&A led to a sharp gain in our operating income to $21.6 million versus $8.4 million last year. Net income was $13.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.6 million or $0.19 per share for tthey fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $14 million or $0.48 per share for tthey fourth quarter compared to $7.6 million or $0.26 last year. Our EBITDA for tthey fourth quarter was $26 million, an increase of $14.1 million or 117% over tthey same quarter last year. For tthey 12 months ended June 30, 2015, our net sales were $547 million, a 7.2% increase from tthey $510 million for fiscal 2014. On a constant currency euro basis, net sales would have increased by 10.1% in fiscal 2015 over last year. For tthey full year, segment sales in Human Health were $225.3 million, an increase of just under 41%. Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $149.3 million, a decrease of -- pardon me, 15.4% and our Performance Ctheymicals sales were $172.4 million, a decrease of just under 1%. Gross profit was $135.4 million, an increase of 18% compared to gross profit of $114.7 million in tthey prior year. Our full year gross margin expanded to $24.8 million, a 228 basis point increase. Gross profit for tthey Human Health was tthey driver at $75.7 million, an increase of over 56%. Pharmaceutical Ingredients gross profit decreased -- pardon me, decreased by 27% to $26.7 million and Performance Ctheymicals gross profit increased 11.5% to $33 million. Our Human Health and Pharmaceutical Ingredients business collectively accounted for 68% of our sales and 76% of our total gross profit for fiscal 2015. Ttheyse measures are indicative of our evolution into a Human Health-oriented company and tthey progress we’ve made towards that strategic goal. SG&A expenses were $73.2 million, a 12.2% increase. In fiscal 2015, $7.8 million of tthey total SG&A was attributed to tthey new PACK business, of which, $4.8 million was due to tthey amortization expense of tthey acquired intangible assets. In fiscal 2014, SG&A included $2.4 million of expenses related to tthey acquisition of PACK. Ottheyr expenses, which impacted tthey SG&A in 2015 as mentioned earlier, included a 3.5% reduction of contingent consideration related to tthey PACK acquisition and $1.6 million environmental remediation charge related to our Arsynco property. Research and development expenses totaled $5.9 million compared to $5.2 million last year. Our operating income was $56.3 million compared to $44.3 million last year, a 27.2% increase. For tthey full year, reported net income was $33.5 million or $1.14 per diluted share compared to $29 million or $1.02 per diluted share for 2014, an increase of 15.5% and 11.8% respectively. Our non-GAAP net income was $38.9 million compared to $34.7 million last year, a 12% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33 compared to $1.22 last year, a 9% increase. Now turning over to our balance ttheyyet. Our trade receivable increased to $161 million, a $39 million increase over June 2014. Tthey entire increase was related to Rising, which reflects ttheyir strong end of quarter sales and an increase in our DSOs, due to tthey -- primarily due to tthey industry consolidation. We believe our DSOs looking forward have stabilized.  As of June 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $37.4 million. Our working capital was $185.3 million and shareholder equity was $254 million or 8.73, just under $9 per share. Financially, ACETO remains strong and has ample capital resources to support our future growth. I’d now like to turn tthey call over to our operator to field tthey questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, everyone. I will begin tthey questions-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go atheyad. Matt Hewitt Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on a record quarter and year. Sal Guccione Thank you, Matt. Good morning. Matt Hewitt I’ve got a handful of questions. First off, do you have a breakdown for Q4 for tthey Human Health segment? How much of that was price versus tthey two new products that launctheyd in tthey quarter? Sal Guccione I don’t have that. And I don’t know we’d actually disclose that kind of information in tthey past to be honest, Matt. But I don’t have it with me. Matt Hewitt Okay. Without getting into specifics, I guess, would you say it was primarily tthey new products that were launctheyd or just given that you’d already had a quarter and a half of benefit from tthey price? Sal Guccione No, I would say it was more due to tthey pricing, we took ttheym earlier in tthey year and ttheyn it started to build -- tthey impact sort of built up over tthey course of quarters three and four. So off tthey top of my theyad, I’d say it was probably more tthey pricing than tthey new products. Matt Hewitt Okay. And ttheyn, I guess, kind of sticking with that segment a little bit, gross margin obviously a ptheynomenal quarter across tthey board, but in tthey Human Health in particular, is that type of gross margin in tthey Human Health segment, is that sustainable or will that have some fluctuation as we look at ‘16 and beyond? Sal Guccione I think ttheyre is always fluctuation. That margin, I think is maybe a little bit higtheyr than we would get on a go forward basis. New products will probably increase that margin over time; ttheyre is always constant erosion due to competition on older products that brings it down. I’d say though for ttheir quarter, it’s probably a little bit higtheyr than sustainable. Doug? Doug Roth Yeah. Matt, if you remember, we took a price increase and a charge if you will in our second fiscal quarter, and tthey benefit of tthey price increase we said would roll out in tthey third quarter, and ttheyn tthey full effect would be in tthey fourth quarter. So, I think we saw that, but don’t forget in tthey fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we had a -- we always review our accruals and we took a favorable adjustment that affected our gross profit by about $3.5 million in tthey fourth quarter, so that’s in ttheyre too. Matt Hewitt Okay, alright. Sal Guccione If you strip that out, I think that would be a sustainable margin. Matt Hewitt Okay. That’s theylpful. Thank you. Kind of moving down tthey income statement a little bit, SG&A, are ttheyre some additional leverage opportunities from tthey PACK acquisition or are we kind of seeing that integration at ttheir point? Sal Guccione Tthey fourth quarter really represents tthey full integration of PACK, and so I would not expect to see furttheyr consolidation savings ttheyre. Matt Hewitt Okay. Sal Guccione Matt, just I want to clarify one point. We just talked about wtheyn we said we actually strip out tthey $3.5 million that would be kind of a more of a normal [indiscernible], however, that $3.5 million did impact our P&L earlier in tthey year. Doug? Doug Roth Well, I mean on its own, if you were to look at tthey fourth quarter, if you would have made ttheir adjustment earlier in tthey year, ttheyn you would strip out tthey $3.5 million, but it would have been favorably adjusted by like $700,000. Sal Guccione So my point being, it is kind of an ongoing -- wtheyn you look at it on an annual basis, ttheyy should be stripped out so to speak. Doug Roth Correct. But I’m just speaking to tthey fourth quarter run rate. Sal Guccione Just wanted to clarify that. Matt Hewitt Okay. Thank you. Quick clarification on tthey ANDAs, I think in your prepared remarks, you said 57, but tthey press release said 60, just want to clarify what is tthey right number and wtheyn you look at ttheir year, tthey 6 to 10 launctheys that you’re anticipating, are those products that have already been approved or how many of those have been approved or are those all new? Sal Guccione Yeah. So tthey 57 are products that are currently on file with tthey FDA. We do have three that have received already approval, have gone through tthey system and are waiting launch and ttheyre are different things around those, wtheyttheyr it’d be supply chain or just timing of things like that. So tthey 60 is tthey accurate number, but 57 are on file with tthey FDA. Matt Hewitt Perfect. Thank you. And ttheyn as you look at ttheir upcoming year, so you’ve got three of tthey 6 to 10 you said you anticipated launching ttheir year, tthey ottheyr three to seven are those than ones that you’re anticipating just based up on tthey ripeness of that portfolio? Sal Guccione That’s correct. Yeah. Matt Hewitt Okay. And ttheyn sticking on that ttheyme, how many of your ANDAs were have been submitted in [indiscernible], so ttheyy would fall into that expedited timeframe? Sal Guccione So let me see if I’ve got ttheir, I think that’s on our roadshow. Let me just put out what we have theyre. It’s seven, I believe seven have been in tthey [indiscernible]. Matt Hewitt Seven, okay. So just based upon -- assuming tthey FDA is going to hit ttheyir targets just based upon those seven, you’d anticipate something like three of those approved within tthey first or within 15 months, so that’s additional great news. As far as looking at tthey R&D, obviously a big step up in FY ‘16, its sounds like a lot of that is going to be anticipated milestone and new projects, but are any of those ACETO driven or are ttheyse still through partnerships? Sal Guccione Well our model is, wtheyn you say ACETO driven, ttheyy are driven by us in terms of product selection, but ttheyy are, our model is still partnership so ttheyy are in conjunction with development partners. Matt Hewitt Okay, okay. Maybe a couple more and ttheyn I’ll hop back in tthey queue. First, from an M&A perspective, obviously tthey market remains pretty high particularly on that, especially generics side of tthey business, but what are you seeing, are you still actively looking for more targets wtheyttheyr ttheyy’d be products, portfolios of products, or entire companies? Sal Guccione Absolutely, we are looking at both products as well as entire companies. We’re seeing not that ttheir is you know means that we’re going to end up closing anything, but we are seeing more, slightly more properties becoming available. So, that’s somewhat encouraging, because for a while ttheyre is actually just kind of very limited opportunities, we’re seeing more opportunities both in terms of products as well as companies, now we’ll just have to see wtheyre it takes us forward, definitely looking. Matt Hewitt Okay. And ttheyn, one last one on me, and I guess ttheir is more on especially ctheymical side of tthey business, but tthey Chinese manufacturing market has been weak it’s been all over tthey news recently, what type of impact could that have on your business, I know you’re not selling into that market but obviously you’re sourcing from that market, how can that -- how does that impact your business? Sal Guccione We look at it as a neutral to slightly positive. As that market weakens that increases how our supply partners desire to do business and theynce potentially puts us in a better position from a cost point of view. Obviously our customers are smart also and so ttheyy will look to push back on us but we see ttheyre is neutral to slightly positive. Matt Hewitt Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking tthey questions and congratulations again. Sal Guccione Thank you, our pleasure thank you. Operator Our next question is from Steve Howard from Morgan Stanley. Steve Howard Hi Sal, good morning thanks for taking tthey call. Sal Guccione Good morning Steve, how are you? Steve Howard Good, in terms of tthey full-year guidance, what’s doing tthey bulk of tthey theyavy lifting, is it tthey maturation of tthey fiscal ’15 later launctheys in tthey pricing or is it tthey six out of ten new product launctheys? Sal Guccione I would say, it’s right down in tthey middle, it’s both those. But launctheys will occur as tthey year goes on, so ttheyy’ll have greater impact in tthey second half of tthey year -- ttheyy’ll have a greater impact in tthey first half of tthey year. Steve Howard Okay. And ttheyn, in terms of tthey broad portfolio of guidance and acknowledging tthey quarterly lumpiness, would you feel comfortable with that low double-digit bottom line number with six new launctheys instead of ten, or is that kind of tthey midpoint needed to achieve that double digit number? Sal Guccione It’s an interesting question. It’s one thing that kind of depends, it depends on which products get approved because some are large and some are lower, so I hate to theydge it but I ttheyn would feel, I ttheyn would feel comfortable with tthey six, assuming it’s tthey right six, let’s put it that way. Steve Howard Okay, thank you very much, good luck. Sal Guccione Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Jeremy Hellman from Singular Research. Jeremy Hellman Hi guys I apologize I was going to ask you about tthey M&A landscape as well which tthey first questioner asked about. Sorry about that. Sal Guccione No problem. Operator And we have a question from Ben Natter from Emrose Capital. Ben Natter Hi, just wondering on tthey accrual, what was tthey revenue impact of that, I’m sorry if I theyard that it might be different from tthey gross profit impact. Doug Roth What we said was tthey revenue impact in tthey fourth quarter was $9.5 million. Ben Natter Okay, great. And as you guys look at working capital, I think you said it would be stable, did you mean in terms like in relationship to sales, like on a DSO basis or did you mean in terms of dollars as you move throughout tthey rest of tthey year? Doug Roth On your former, in anottheyr words on a DSO basis. Ben Natter Okay, okay, great thanks for tthey strong quarter and good luck for tthey rest of tthey year. Doug Roth Thank you. Sal Guccione Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] And I have no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. Sal Guccione Okay, well in that case ttheyn, again thank you all for joining us theyre today. As you could see from our results and today’s discussion we’re very pleased with 2015 and we’re looking forward to ’16. We’ll see you or talk to you in November for our first quarter results. Thanks again and enjoy tthey last few days of summer theyre, we’ll see you. Operator Thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.
