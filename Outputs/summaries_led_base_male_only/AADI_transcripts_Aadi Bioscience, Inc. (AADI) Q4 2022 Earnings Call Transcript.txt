 we report on our financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and provide an update on our operations and plans for 2023. 
 we also provide an update on our ongoing clinical activities including the launch of our first product, FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant pEComa, a rare form of sarcoma with no prior standard treatment. this launch was closely followed by the initiation of our registration-directed trial PRECISION 1, a study in patients with solid tumors that have tSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations in the mTOR pathway. 
 we achieved sales of $15.2 million in 2022 outperforming estimates for the year in just 10 months on the market. as we progressed on both the commercial and clinical fronts, we announced the completion of a pipe financing of $72.5 million, extending our runway into 2025 and supporting our ongoing operations and further expansion of our initiatives.
