 we report strong organic sales growth in the second quarter of 2019 of 35% on an organic basis, driven by double-digit growth across all four of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals, nutrition and medical devices. excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter of 2019.    
 we forecast continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter of last year.    
 we also forecast continued strong double-digit growth in our core laboratory and molecular diagnostics business and a sequential step down in the second quarter of this year.    
 we expect that trend to continue in the second half of the year.    
 we continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021.    
 we also expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales.    
 we now open the line for questions.
