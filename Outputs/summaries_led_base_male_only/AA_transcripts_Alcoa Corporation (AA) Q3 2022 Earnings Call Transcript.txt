 we report third quarter results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. 
 we report a net loss of $746 million or $4.17 per share and an adjusted net loss of $60 million or $0.33 per share. 
 our quarterly net loss was driven primarily by a non-cash charge for pension annuitization, coupled with the sequential decline in Aluminum and Alumina prices and higher costs for energy and raw materials. in the quarter, we continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and provided returns to our stockholders in the form of a quarterly dividend of $18 million and completed stock purchases. 
 we also continue to address operational improvements across our system, including in our Australia refining system and we are continuing to take actions on our operating levels. in our global smelting portfolio, we are continuing to address our overall capacity, including progressing with restarting previously idle capacity at two sites. in Brazil, we continued to add new operations at the Alumar joint venture where the restart continues to progress. 
 we also continue to look at ways to improve the cost structure at both facilities. 
 finally, we discuss the impact of the energy crisis in the world on our industry and the impact of sanctions on the market.
