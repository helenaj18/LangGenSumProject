 we report financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 and provide an outlook for the future as we head into 2021. 
 our results for the third quarter of 2020 were primarily impacted by the ongoing pandemic environment, mainly our educational travel services segment as almost all tours were canceled. at the same time, many students continued to pursue their studies online. for the third quarter of 2020, credit hours deliveries for our portfolio training programs decreased from the prior year period, which was primarily a reflection of the continuing COVID-19 environment. 
 however, there was a 58.2% sequential increase from the number of portfolio training credit hours delivered as reported in quarter 2, which we believe was the result of traditional in-person delivery becoming increasingly available during the quarter and also speaks to the effectiveness of our online platform as many students continue to pursue their studies remotely. during the third quarter, we also launched new internship programs to allow our students to gain experience in the working world at certain globally recognized companies.
