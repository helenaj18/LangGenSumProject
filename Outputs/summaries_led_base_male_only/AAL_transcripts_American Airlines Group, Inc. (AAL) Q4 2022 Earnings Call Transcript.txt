Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $827 million and a full year net income of $328 million. Revenue in the fourth quarter was higher than any fourth quarter in company history. American also produced record revenues of $49 billion for the full year, which is a 7% increase over 2019, while flying 8.7% less capacity than we did in the fourth quarter of 2019. Demand for air travel strengthened as we went through 2022, and we expect industry revenue will return to its historical share of GDP in 2023. our team has delivered a third consecutive quarterly profit and fourth quarter margins that are higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 despite our fuel price increasing by approximately 70%.    
 we generated nearly $2.4 billion in pre-tax profits over the past three quarters, and we are pleased to report a full year profit for the first time in 2019.    in addition to running a reliable operation and generating a $2.1 billion pre-tax profit, we have made significant progress on repairing our balance sheet since the pandemic.    
 we have now reduced our total debt by more than $8.2 billion or more than half of our goal to reduce total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025, only 18 months into our deleveraging program.    
 we will use our free cash flow to pay down $3.3 billion in debt amortization this year, and we expect that by the end of 2023, we will have reduced total debt by $10 billion to $11 billion from peak levels in mid-2021.    
 we will continue to focus on delivering on our stated objectives. and we will continue to make sure that we have a business model that works in any demand environment with any set of constraints.    
 we are set up to run a reliable operation in 2023, including investing in our team, our fleet and technology to support our operations and we are seeing this work pay off as our operation is off to a strong start just a few weeks into 2023, including the best on-time arrival performance of the nine largest U.S. carriers so far this year.    
 we will also open the line for analyst questions.
