 we report third quarter fiscal 2014 net sales of 370.6 million and net income of 5.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to net income of 7.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the comparable quarter of last year. our third quarter earnings were lower than those achieved last year primarily due to quarterly timing differences. for the nine -month period, we are reporting net income of 23.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to 16.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior nine -month period. for the third quarter of 2014, we reported net sales of 370.6 million, a 1.6% decrease from the 376.6 million reported for the comparable year 2013. Gross profit was 85.7 million, an increase of 16.2% compared to the gross profit of 73.7 million in the prior year period. Gross profit in the Human Health segment was 10.1 million, a decrease of 8.8% and gross profit in the Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment was 7.4 million, a decrease of 44.6% reflecting the initial sales in last year's third quarter of a new high margin API which, as expected, had no sales in the current period. in our Performance Chemicals segment, although sales had declined, our gross profit increased to 7.5 million or 5.4% due to the improved product mix brought about by pruning of some of our higher volume, lower margin products. Operating income was 35.2 million compared to 26 million in the same period last year, a 35% year-over -year increase. our total company gross margin is 23% for the nine months and that compares to 19.6% for the same period last year. during the third quarter, we reduced our bank borrowing by an additional 2 million leaving us with bank debt of 22.9 million and shareholder equity of 223.4 million.
