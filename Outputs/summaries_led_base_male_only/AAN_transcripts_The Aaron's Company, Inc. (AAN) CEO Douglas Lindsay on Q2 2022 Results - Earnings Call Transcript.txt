 we report results for the second quarter of 2022, which includes the first results from the BrandsMart acquisition, which closed on April 1. in the second quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues were $610.4 million, an increase of 30.6% over the same period in 2021. 
 adjusted EBITDA was $48.1 million, an increase of 11.2% over the same period in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.9% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 14% in the second quarter of 2021. on a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.79 in the second quarter of 2022, compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 in the same quarter in the same year period. 
 this decline was primarily due to the normalization of customer demand following a strong second quarter in 2021, which we believe benefited from last year's government stimulus. 
 we also experienced higher lease merchandise returns, an increase in charge offs and a decline in the lease portfolio size in the second quarter of 2022.
