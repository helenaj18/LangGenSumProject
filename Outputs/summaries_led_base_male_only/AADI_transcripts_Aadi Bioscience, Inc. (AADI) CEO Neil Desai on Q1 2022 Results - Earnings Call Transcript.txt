 we report financial results for the quarter ended march 31, 2022 and discuss the launch of our first product, FYARRO, an albumin-bound mTOR inhibitor, also known as napsurolomus, for advanced malignant pEComa.  in 6 weeks since launch, we achieved $2.3 million in net sales of FYARRO despite the small and ultrarare nature of this disease.  we attribute this encouraging performance to several factors including a group of patients treated in the expanded access program and the precision on tumor-agnostic trial, were successfully transitioned to commercial product within the first few weeks of launch, favorable payer sentiment and patient demand.  in addition, we delivered on our promise to begin enrolling patients in our new registration-directed tumor-agnostic trial known as PRECISION1 in the first half of this year.  we are now the first and only FDA-approved treatment specifically indicated for advanced malignant pEComa patients and the first and only mTOR inhibitor approved for this indication.  we are also very pleased with the early acceptance of this novel mTOR inhibitor by the oncology physician community.    
 we will now discuss some early insights regarding the launch of FYARRO in advanced malignant pEComa.
