 this is a conference call to discuss the third quarter results of the oilfield services company profrac Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:ACDC ). 
 we are pleased to report 18% sequential growth in revenue and 22% sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2022. 
 adjusted EBITDA per fleet excluding other business activities rose 23% to $34 million from $28.1 million in the second quarter. 
 this represents a 23% improvement from the prior quarter. Pricing continued to move higher during the quarter and we see continued momentum with a data-driven approach. 
 in addition to pricing, we saw further incremental expansion from increased bundling of materials used in the services provided by ProFrac. Vertical integration allows us to capture more share of our customers' completions budget and this is a priority for profrac as we believe it represents our largest topline growth opportunity in 2023. 
 finally, we are excited to announce the deployment of our first internally manufactured electric fleet in the third quarter and we look forward to demonstrating the value of those assets to our customers.
