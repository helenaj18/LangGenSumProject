 we report our third quarter results and discuss our strategy for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
 our net sales grew nine point nine percent to two and a half dollars billion compared to the prior year, and we delivered comparable sales growth of ten point two percent. adjusted operating income increased by approximately 33 percent to 272 dollars million, and our adjusted operating income margin rate increased 183 basis points to ten point seven percent. in addition, we strengthened our cash and liquidity position throughout the quarter, highlighted our quarterly free cash flow improvement of 95 percent and a deferral of federal payroll of fifty three million dollars compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 these results were driven by the external drivers discussed earlier, coupled with our eROI growth initiatives.
