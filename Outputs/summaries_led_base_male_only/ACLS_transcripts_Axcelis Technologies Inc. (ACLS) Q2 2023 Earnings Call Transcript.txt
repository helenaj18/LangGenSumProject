 we report on our second quarter 2023 financial results and are excited about full-year revenue of approximately $1.1 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 20% and represents year-over-year earnings per share of approximately $1.86. Revenue for the second quarter was $274 million with system revenue at $215.2 million and contract sales and engineering at $58.8 million. 
 gross margin was 43.7% and 170 basis points above guidance, driven by lower costs in deferrals and a slightly improved mix. 
 operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue and better than our guidance. Backlog remained high at $1.2 billion with quarterly systems bookings of $193 million, also driven by strong demand for the Purion product family and strength in the power market. 
 we expect the third quarter of 2023 to have revenue of approximately $280 million, gross margin of roughly 44%, operating profit of around $64 million and earnings per share of approximately $1.72. we are raising our forecasted 2023 revenue by $70 million to greater than $1.1 billion and beyond.
