 we report our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 financial results and provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop a functional cure for chronic hepatitis b virus and a novel and superior treatment for coronavirus outbreaks.    
 our strategy is to target two essential enzymes critical for bio-replication and that are highly conserved across all known coronaviruses.  
 these two targets are the sARS-CoV-2 nsp5 main proteases, also known as EMPro; and the nsp12 viral polymerase.  
 we plan to identify compounds that target each of these essential enzymes, develop those compounds and ultimately combine them to pursue an optimized treatment regimen that is safe, effective, convenient and able to address current and future coronavirus strains.    
 we also highlight our anticipated milestones for 2023, which include: Ericouncing 729 data from our two ongoing Phase IIa combination trials ; and additional off-treatment data from our Phase Ib clinical trial.    
 we also intend to initiate in 2023 three additional clinical trials with our early-stage compounds, namely: AB-101, our oral PD-1 inhibitor ; AB-161, our oral RNA destabilizer ; and
