 acelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRX ) reported first quarter 2019 financial results and provided an update on our commercial launch of dSUVIA in a press release. with me today are Vince Angotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dr. Pam Palmer, our Chief Medical Officer. this call is being webcast live on the Events page of the Investors section of acelRx s website at acelrx.com. 
 we report revenues of $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2019, in-line with 2018 and reflect only five weeks of selling with a staged sales team approach including only 15 account managers. 
 we are on track to achieve 125 formulary approvals by the end of the year, which will set the foundation for further growth in acute pain management. 
 we also announce earlier today that we have become an approved vendor at one of the largest ambulatory surgical center, or ASC networks in the U.S., allowing physicians to use DSUVIA at the more than 300 locations much like a formulary approval at a hospital.
