 this is a conference call to discuss the second quarter 2022 financial results and business update of Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc. 
 we are on track to submit our first biologics license application for afami-cel for the treatment of synovial sarcoma in the fourth quarter of this year. 
 if approved, this will be the first commercially available engineered tCR cell therapy for solid tumors. 
 we will use this submission and the focused launch to ensure future commercial launches will be even more successful. 
 we also have a next generation cell therapy to be more potent and to deliver responses across a range of solid tumors in addition to sarcoma. 
 we will present updated data from our signal-finding phase 1 SURPASS trial with this next gen cell therapy at this conference.
