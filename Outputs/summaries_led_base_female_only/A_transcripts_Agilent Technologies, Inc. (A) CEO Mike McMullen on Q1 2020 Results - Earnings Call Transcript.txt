 we report strong growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with revenues of $1.36 billion, up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. 
 this growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. 
 our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth in the quarter. 
 we continue to translate our high growth into strong bottomline growth with non-GAAP earnings of $0.81 per share up 7% on a reported basis and 1.4% on a core basis in the quarter. 
 we are also seeing a pickup in our biopharma and cell analysis business in the first half of our fiscal year. 
 this was partially offset by a mid single digit decline in our business in China due to the impact of the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus in that country. 
 we remain confident about the longer term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth strategy and most importantly our team.
