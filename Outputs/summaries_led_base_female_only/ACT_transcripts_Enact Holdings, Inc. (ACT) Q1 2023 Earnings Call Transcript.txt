 during the first quarter of 2023, we delivered a 17% return on equity and net income of $176 million or $1.08 per diluted share, which was up 7% year-over-year. Insurance in-force in the quarter was a record of $253 billion, driven by persistency of 85% and new insurance written of $13 billion as we continued to win new business. during the quarter, we executed a reinsurance transaction as part of our credit risk transfer program, which secured excess of loss coverage from a panel of highly rated reinsurers covering our new insurance written throughout 2023 and providing up to $180 million of reinsurance coverage on our 2023 book year. 
 we continue to focus on prudently managing our risks, driving cost efficiencies across our business and maintaining a strong balance sheet with the financial and operational flexibility to adapt to market conditions. in the first quarter, we were able to reduce our operating expenses by 13% sequentially, driving a 400 basis point decrease in our expense ratio, despite the ongoing impact of inflation on the economy more broadly. 
 we are also able to return capital to shareholders in the first quarter of 2023 by repurchasing an additional $22 million in stock and by increasing our dividend by 14% to $0.16 per common share.
