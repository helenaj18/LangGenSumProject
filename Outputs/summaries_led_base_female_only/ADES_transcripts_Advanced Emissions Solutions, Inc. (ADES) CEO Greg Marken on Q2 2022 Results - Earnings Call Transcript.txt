 our bottom line performance was slightly below breakeven as net loss of $0.3 million compared to net loss of $16.6 million in 2021. for the 6 months ending in the second quarter of 2022, revenues and cost of revenues were $51.1 million and $41.4 million, respectively, compared to $43.7 million and $28.7 million for the first half of 2021. 
 our consumables revenue for the quarter was $24.7 million, which reflects year-over-year growth in excess of 41% for the second consecutive quarter. 
 our gross margin also improved to 19.5% compared to 15.4% in the prior year. 
 we continue to face margin headwinds due to tight inventory conditions and the expected full year impact of incremental carbon purchases to supplement inventory as well as broader supply chain and inflationary challenges that are applying upward pressure on costs related to transportation, freight and other necessary product inputs. 
 we continue to strive to mitigate these cost pressures through price increases and overall improvement in commercial contracts related to our consumable products as those contracts allow. 
 we also continue to see strong customer interest in other growing market opportunities, utilizing both existing and developing product technologies and capabilities that may provide earnings opportunities in areas where we had not previously competed.    
 we are and expect to continue to be a leading provider of choice for these activated carbon technologies and believe that our strong financial and operating platform have us well positioned going forward.
