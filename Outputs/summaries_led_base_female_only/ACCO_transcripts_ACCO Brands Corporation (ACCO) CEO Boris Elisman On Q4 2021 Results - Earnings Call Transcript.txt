 we report results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and discuss our outlook for the full year of 2022. 
 our 2021 reported net sales increased 22% to $2.03 billion, largely due to the contribution from the acquisition of PowerA. Adjusted net income was $137 million and adjusted EPS was $1.41, a $0.46 improvement versus prior year. our comparable sales rose 5% as we had higher pricing and improved volume in most markets. the 5% comparable sales growth for our total business was higher than our expected long-term sales growth of 2% to 4% due to the economic recovery. 
 the 5% comparable sales growth was led by retail and e-tail, helped by the addition of PowerA. on the product side, in addition to strong PowerA sales growth we had double-digit growth in shredding, stapling products, air purifiers, art products and note taking. 
 we also saw good growth in independent dealers and wholesalers. 
 we expect to continue to help margins by our continuous productivity programs and expect to again deliver approximately $30 million in full year expense savings. 
 we expect our free cash flow to be at least $165 million, cash from operations of at least $190 million and CapEx of at least $25 million in 2022. 
 we expect to return to a historically more balanced capital allocation that will include dividends, debt reduction and opportunistic repurchases of our shares.
