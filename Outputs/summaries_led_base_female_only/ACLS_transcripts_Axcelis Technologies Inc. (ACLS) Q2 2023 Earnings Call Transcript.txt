 we report on our second quarter 2023 financial results and are excited about full-year revenue of approximately $1.1 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 20% in a year in which overall wFE is expected to decrease by 20% to 30%. 
 we are also raising our forecasted 2023 revenue by $70 million to greater than $1.1 billion and potentially beyond that. Revenue for the second quarter was $274 million with earnings per share of $1.86. Q2 gross margin finished at 43.7% and 170 basis points above guidance, driven by lower costs in deferrals and a slightly improved mix. Backlog remained high at $1.2 billion with quarterly systems bookings of $193 million, also driven by strong demand for the Purion product family and strength in the power market. 
 we now expect approximately 60% of our shipped system revenue in 2023 to come from this segment, with around 35% of total shipped system revenue coming from silicon carbide applications. the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenue of approximately $280 million, gross margin of roughly 44%, operating profit of around $64 million and earnings per share of approximately $1.72. we
