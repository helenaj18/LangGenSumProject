 we report a first quarter net loss of $1.3 billion or $1.97 per share excluding net special items. 
 this loss was driven by the extreme drop in demand for air travel due to the global pandemic. 
 our revenues in the quarter were down 62% from the same period in 2019. our first quarter total operating expense, excluding net special items, was effectively flat on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2020 on a 39% reduction in total capacity. 
 our first quarter revenue was up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter as we gradually added back capacity. this trend was driven by strong leisure demand in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America. And this is in spite of business and long-haul international demand remaining weak, with net bookings of roughly 20% of their 2019 levels in the first quarter. 
 we were cash positive in the month of March, our first such month since the beginning of the pandemic. 
 these results and more were made possible by our incredible team and their resiliency and determination to work to a very difficult future.    
 thanks to our team, in a thoughtful and proactive plan as the green flag drops, we are ready
