 we report on our first quarter 2023 financial results and discuss our plans for commercialization in 2025. 
 we also provide an update on our manufacturing efforts with a focus on our recently announced manufacturing partnership with Stellantis, one of the world s largest automakers whose iconic brands include Jeep, Ram and Maserati. our strategy of realistic innovation led us to optimize the design of our batteries and electric engines to facilitate a more streamlined certification process and support our plan to ramp up manufacturing to allow us to deliver hundreds of aircraft per year shortly after getting to certification. the past few months have seen this strategy deliver dividends as the team has made great strides on the engineering certification and manufacturing of these key systems. we ended the quarter with $450 million of cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. 
 our ending cash balance coupled with the potential $150 million in equity capital from Stellantis, i previously discussed, provides us with potential liquidity of around $600 million to get through to commercialization in 2025. as we continue to progress our manufacturing operations and mature our commercialization efforts, we also remain focused on maintaining a healthy cash runway.
