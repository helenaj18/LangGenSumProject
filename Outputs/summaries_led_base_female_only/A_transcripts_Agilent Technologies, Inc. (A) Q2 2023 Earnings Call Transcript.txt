 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we delivered 9.5% core growth in revenues of $1.72 billion and earnings per share of $1.27, both up 12% on a reported basis. 
 our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. in the first half of the year, we were expecting double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. 
 we now expect core revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% and earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% in the second half of the year. 
 our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we are doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leveraged earnings growth in the second half of the year.
