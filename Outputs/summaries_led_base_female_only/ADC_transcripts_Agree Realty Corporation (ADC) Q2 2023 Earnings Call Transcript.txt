 during the second quarter, we continued our strong start to the year deploying significant capital across our three external growth platforms, maintaining near full occupancy and further solidifying our balance sheet. during the quarter, we invested approximately $324 million in 120 high-quality retail net leased properties across our three external growth platforms. 
 this includes the acquisition of 92 assets for approximately $305 million. 
 the weighted average cap rate on the acquired properties had a weighted average of 6.8% relative to full year expansion and was higher than full year expansion by 60 basis points relative to the first quarter. 
 the weighted average weighted term of the acquired properties was approximately 10 years and was higher than full year expansion by 10 basis points relative to the first quarter.    
 we also increased our acquisition volume by approximately 73 million during the quarter with 73% of the annualized base rent acquired in the first six months of the year coming from leading investment grade retailers.    
 we anticipate our acquisition volume for the third quarter to be at least 70 basis points higher than last year and we anticipate our acquisition volume for the third year to be at least 1 billion.    
 we also continue to see significant activity across our development in developer funding platforms as evidenced by the 31 projects completed under construction, representing a record capital commitment of approximately $126 million.    
 we also continue to invest in information technology and made further enhancements to our proprietary ARC database.    
 we continue to see a lack of competition within our targeted sandbox and our ability to move quickly and with certainty makes us the buyer of choice in today s market.    
 we continue to be selective, we have no near-term debt maturities, no floating rate exposure, and we can continue to remain opportunistic.    
 we have no debt maturities until 2028.
