 this is a transcript of the conference call for the first quarter of 2023 held on march 27, 2023. 
 the company kicked off 2023 with excellent underwriting results across the segments and our investment income continued its upward path, benefiting from a higher interest rate environment and strong cash flows. for the quarter, we reported after tax operating income of $0.73 per share and an annualized return on common equity of 20.7%. 
 net premiums written were up by 35% over the same period last year and net premiums earned were up slightly on a sequential basis reflecting the increased persistency of our insurance in force during the quarter at U.S. MI and good growth in our units outside of it. 
 our mortgage segment also performed well with net premium revenue growth of 19.1% over the same quarter 1 year ago and an [indiscernible] quarter combined ratio excluding cat of 89.8%. 
 our fixed income portfolio was stable at 2.54% on a U.S. dollar basis for the quarter with all our strategies delivering positive returns. 
 our high-quality insurance in force portfolio remained stable at $513 million.
