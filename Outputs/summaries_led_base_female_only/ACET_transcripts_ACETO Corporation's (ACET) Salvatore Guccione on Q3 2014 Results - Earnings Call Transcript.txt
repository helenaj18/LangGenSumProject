 we report third quarter fiscal 2014 net sales of 370.6 million and net income of 5.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to net income of 7.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the comparable quarter of last year. our third quarter earnings were lower than those achieved last year primarily due to quarterly timing differences. for the nine -month period, net sales were 370.6 million and net income was 23.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to 16.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior nine - month period. in this quarter, we also reported the closing of our acquisition of PACK Pharmaceuticals, a new distributor of ingredients to the cosmetic and personnel care industries that we acquired early this year.
