 we report on our third quarter financial results and business update and discuss our plans for the next few years.  we will focus on the afami-cel cell therapy for people with synovial sarcoma, the first engineered cell therapy for a solid tumor, and the SURPASS trials of our second generation cell therapy for people with ovarian, bladder, and head and neck cancers in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.    
 we will also discuss the allogeneic platform for our wholly-owned and our partnered programs.    
 thanks for your time and attention today.
