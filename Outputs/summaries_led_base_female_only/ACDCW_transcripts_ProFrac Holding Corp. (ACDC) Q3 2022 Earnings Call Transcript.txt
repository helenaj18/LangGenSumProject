 we report on our third quarter results and outlook for the fourth quarter and look forward to generating significant revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter and the first half of the next decade. 
 we achieved 18% sequential growth in revenue and 22% sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter. 
 adjusted EBITDA per fleet excluding other business activities rose 23% to $34 million from $28.1 million in the second quarter. 
 this represents a 23% improvement from the prior quarter. Pricing continued to move higher during the quarter and we see continued momentum with a data-driven approach. 
 we also saw further incremental expansion from increased bundling of materials used in the services provided by ProFrac. 
 we expect our third sand mine to be operational in late November and we look forward to demonstrating the value of those assets to our customers. 
 we continue to believe electric tracking represents the future of the industry and we are excited to leverage our scale and capabilities along with the Clean Fleet technology as the largest provider of electric fracturing services in the world.
