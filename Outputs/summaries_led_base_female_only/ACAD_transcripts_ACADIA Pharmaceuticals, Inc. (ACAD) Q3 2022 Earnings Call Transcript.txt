 we report third quarter net sales of $130.7 million, driven by sequential demand growth of 2% and an acceleration of growth in the long-term care channel.  we also report a reduction in inventory of approximately $7 million impacting net sales by approximately $7 million in the third quarter of this year.    
 we continue to focus on the long-term care channel where we have the highest number of newly diagnosed patients and the highest occupancy rates in the channel.   
 we also continue to focus on developing new products for schizophrenia and rett syndrome, including tripinatide for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia and trufinitat for the treatment of rett syndrome.    
 we also continue to invest in our pipeline of late and early-stage clinical candidates, most notably our negative symptoms of schizophrenia Phase III program and our ACP 204 program.    
 we will now turn it over to the operator for questions.
