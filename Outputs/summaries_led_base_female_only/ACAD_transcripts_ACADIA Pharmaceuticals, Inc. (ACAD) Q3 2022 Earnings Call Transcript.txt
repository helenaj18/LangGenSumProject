 we report third quarter 2022 net sales of $130.7 million, driven by 2% sequential demand growth in the second quarter.  our gross to net adjustment increased to 18.6% during the quarter compared to 15.2% in the third quarter of last year.  this was driven by sequential demand growth of 2% in the long-term care channel and an acceleration of growth in the long-term care channel.  on a year-to-date comparison to 2021, net sales were up 8% and SG&A expenses were down 9% as we continue to optimize our commercial PDP spend.  we continue to focus on maximizing the long-term value of the brand and on developing new products for schizophrenia and other rare diseases.    
 we also continue to invest in our pipeline of late and early-stage clinical candidates, most notably our negative symptoms of schizophrenia Phase III program and our ACP 204 program.
