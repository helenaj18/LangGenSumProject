 we are off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance across our therapeutic portfolio. 
 total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
 this includes strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and esthetics, as well as high single digit operational growth from hematological oncology. 
 our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. 
 we also continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. in esthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next generation toxins and filler programs. 
 we also continue to make great progress on our late stage pipeline, including the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021.
