 aECOM (NYSE:ACM ) delivered 5% organic revenue growth in the second quarter and organic revenue increased by 5%. 
 this marks the sixth consecutive quarter with positive organic growth and was led by the higher-margin DCS and MS segments. 
 we delivered total wins of $6.9 billion, which is the second highest quarterly total in the company s history and resulted in a 1.4 book-to-burn ratio in all three segments with the highest growth in the DCS and MS segments. 
 this momentum continued into the first half of the year, where we already have more than $6 billion of wins in the MS segment alone. 
 we expect continued momentum in the business mainly due to the growth in the higher margin segments of DCS and MS, and that gives us a great deal of comfort and confidence in the long-term profitable growth of this business. 
 we also delivered free cash flow of $95 million in the second quarter and $129 million for the first half of the year, which are both ahead of last year. as a result, we are on pace with our guidance for the year and remain committed to our long-term shareholder value-focused capital allocation goals.
