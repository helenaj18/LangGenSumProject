 ascent Industries (NASDAQ:ACNT ) reported net loss of $5.2 million or $0.51 diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared to net loss of $10.3 million or $0.99 diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022. Net sales were $82.5 million compared to $116.2 million in the prior year period. Gross profit was $4.3 million compared to $22.5 million in the first quarter of 2022, while gross margin was 5.2% compared to 19.4% in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was a negative $1.6 million compared to $17 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to the aforementioned lower gross profit as well as higher restructuring and severance costs within the Tubular Products segment. Despite the complexities we faced in the first quarter from confluence of our confluence of our galvanized line down and fairly broad broadening destocking, we remain confident that we can produce a more normalized stream of earnings over the second half of the year and over the latter half of the year.
