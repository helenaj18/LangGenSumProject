 this is a conference call for shareholders of the Shirley's, Inc. second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. 
 the company reported revenues of $1 billion, an increase of 6.4% over the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $129.8 million, an increase of 20.9% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to strong customer payment activity and lower operating expenses and write-offs, partially offset by a smaller lease portfolio balance to begin the quarter. SG&A expenses were 10.5% of revenues in the quarter, compared to 12.3% in the prior-year period, an improvement of 180 basis points. Write-offs in the second quarter were 3.7% of lease revenues, a 190-basis point improvement driven by strong customer payment activity and more conservative lease positioning, partially offset by an increasing mix of e-commerce write-offs. 
 e-com recurring revenue written increased 16.9% slightly negatively impacted by lower inventory availability and more conservative lease decisioning.
