 we report results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and discuss our strategy for the future. 
 we ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity, including more than $550 million of outstanding forward equity available at our election. 
 we ended pro forma for the settlement of the $557 million of outstanding forward equity at 12/31 at approximately 3.1 times leverage and pro forma net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 3.1 times at 12/31. our best-in-class portfolio is very well positioned to withstand the current macroeconomic environment regardless of the level of deterioration in the economy. 
 we continue to invest in our best-in-class auto- and home-improvement and retail properties through 131 $405 million of acquisition activity during the fourth quarter representing approximately 70% of total annualized base rents. 
 over 70% of the remaining annualized base rents are derived from the best investment grade retailers, while ground leases represented more than 5% of rents acquired. 
 we also commenced a record 28 development and Partner Capital Solutions projects for total committed capital of nearly $110 million.
