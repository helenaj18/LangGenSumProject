 we report on our financial results for the second quarter of 2023 and summarize recent achievements in recent corporate updates.  we report a 77% year-over-year increase in total revenues of approximately $60.1 million during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to approximately $33.9 million during the first quarter of 2023.  our gross profit for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023, was $16.7 million as compared to $7.8 million for the same period of a year ago, and this represents an increase of $8.9 million.  our adjusted net loss was $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2023, a significant period-over-period improvement.  we also report a 160% sequential growth in our adjusted EBITDA base of $6.4 million during the second quarter of 2023, which represents an increase of 160% sequential growth compared to the first quarter of 2023.  we are now raising fiscal year 2023 total revenue guidance to more than $240 million, upwardly revised from the $220 million previously provided.  we anticipate continued growth in adjusted EBITDA throughout the remainder of 2023 and beyond.     
 we also report on progress in advancing yield enhancement initiatives with the potential to increase both peak revenues and margin potential upon the successful validation of commercial scale production and receipt of requisite regulatory approvals.    
 finally, we report on a record number of primary immune-deficient patients treated during the second quarter of 2023 and gain strong market share, paving the way for promising new business prospects and expected go-forward success in this market segment.     
 we believe our continued success in the growing USD 10 billion immunoglobulin end market is attributable to our innovative business model, unique product portfolio, targeted medical education efforts and most importantly, our core focus on treating underserved immune deficient patient populations.  we believe it is this concentration that has enabled ADMA to maintain its position as the fastest-growing provider of immune globulin in the United States marketplace.
