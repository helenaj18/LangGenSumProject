 we report third quarter results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. 
 we report a net loss of $746 million or $4.17 per share and diluted loss per share was $0.33 per share. Adjusted net loss was $60 million and diluted loss per share was $0.32 per share. 
 our quarterly net loss was driven primarily by a non-cash charge for pension annuitization, coupled with the sequential decline in Aluminum and Alumina prices and higher costs for energy and raw materials. in the quarter, we continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and provided returns to our stockholders in the form of a quarterly dividend of $18 million and completed stock purchases. in our global smelting portfolio, we are continuing to address our overall capacity, including progressing with restarting previously idle capacity at two sites. in Brazil, we continued to add new operations at the Alumar joint venture where the restart continues to progress. 
 we also continue to look at ways to improve the cost structure at both facilities. in the third quarter, we are now implementing plans to improve the performance in our refinery system so we can recover from lower volumes that were due to unplanned outages and maintenance. for the
