 we report third quarter 2018 core earnings of $10.3 million or $0.36 per common share and GAAP net income of $10 million or $0.35 per common share. for the first nine months of 2018, our core earnings of $1.05 per share were up 20% year-over-year and were well in excess of the $0.85 year-to-date dividends paid. our strong earnings continue to benefit from comparatively higher levels of invested capital, reduce funding costs, and higher LIBOR rates. for the third quarter of this year, we generated a total of 277 million of new investments with one new investment closing subsequent to quarter end. 
 we have increased our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share, which is a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend since year-end 2017.
