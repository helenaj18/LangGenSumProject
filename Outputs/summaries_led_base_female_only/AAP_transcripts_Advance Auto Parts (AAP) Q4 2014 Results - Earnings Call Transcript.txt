 in 2014, we completed the largest integration project in our industry history by acquiring the combined Advance and CARQUEST businesses. in the fourth quarter, we delivered a 2% comp sales increase in our commercial business and a 1.1% comp sales increase in our DIY business. 
 we also delivered comparable cash earnings per share of $7.59, a 34% increase over the third quarter of 2013. 
 this was driven by a 2% comp for the full year, strong commercial growth, $0.52 in total cost synergies achieved in the year and continued focus and discipline on expense management. 
 we are on track to deliver the total expected cost synergies of $160 million over the 3 years post-acquisition. 
 we continue to focus on methodically improving methodically improving our base business while successfully integrating General Parts. 
 we also continue to invest and further develop our eService capabilities in 2015. 
 we are encouraged by our continuous improvement as an organization as we finished our first year as a combined company and are well-positioned to leverage our size and scale to drive shareholder returns through incremental earnings and strong cash flows for 2015.
