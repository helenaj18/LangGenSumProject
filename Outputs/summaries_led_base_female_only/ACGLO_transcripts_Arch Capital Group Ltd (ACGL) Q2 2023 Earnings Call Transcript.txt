 this is a conference call for investors and analysts on the second quarter of 2023 results of Arch Capital Group.    
 we are more than half way through 2023 and through our commitment to underwriting acumen, prudent reserving and cycle focused capital allocation, we were able to deliver another quarter of profitable growth.  our operating results in the quarter were stellar with an annualized operating return on average common equity of 21.5% that drove a 4.8% increase in Arch's book value of common share for the quarter.  book value per share was $37.04 as of June 30, up 4.8% in the quarter and 13.5% on a year-to-date basis.  in the second quarter, our results were primarily driven by our willingness and ability to deploy capital into lines with superior risk-adjusted returns.  this has helped us achieve exceptional profitable growth over the last several years and helped us achieve one of the sweetest quarters in our company history.    
 this hard market is proving to be one of the longest we've experienced and we are in an enviable position as we look to 2024 and beyond.    
 thanks for joining us today and we look forward to
