 we are off to a strong start to the year, with total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $2.46, both exceeding our expectations. 
 this performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products including, Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, and Vraylar, positive momentum from our aesthetics business, and strong results internationally, and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year. 
 we are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience, where we expect to deliver more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. 
 we also continue to make very good progress across all stages of our therapeutic pipeline, including the launch of new products and expanded indications, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and recently with Vraylar in MDD. in immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. 
 we also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.
