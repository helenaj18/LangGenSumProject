 we report strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 86% year-over-year and nearly 200% year-over-year for the full year of 2021. 
 we sold 139,000 vehicles on our digital marketplace, a 35% increase year-over-year and an increase of over 80% on a two year basis. 
 we continue to gain market share by attracting new dealers to our marketplace and by gaining wallet share within our existing customer base which positions ACV for strong growth going forward. in 2021, we transacted nearly $8 billion of GMV on our marketplace, which is 140% year-over-year growth and pretty incredible when you consider we launched just six years ago.    
 we are on track to generate over $1 billion in revenue with attractive margins through a proven business model that delivers scalable growth with strong unit economics and operating leverage that we believe will drive significant shareholder value.
