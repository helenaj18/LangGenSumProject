 we are here at the 41st annual meeting of the board of the life science tools and diagnostics association of america.    
 this is a phased environment here at the meeting.    
 we are joined by the Agilent team.    
 we will start with an overview of who we are, what we are doing in terms of shareholder value creation, what we have been doing in terms of investments for growth, and then we will move on to what you can expect from us in 2023 after the Agilent team delivered an excellent 2022.   
 we will start with a few key takeaways that came through in my conversation with you this morning.    
 first of all, we have a diversified and resilient business with multiple growth drivers in fast-growing end markets.   
 second, we have a best-in customer service organization and we also tied this very closely to our consumables business.    
 third, we have a great balance sheet and we are going to use it to drive investments for growth as a top priority.    
 fourth, we have a solid and diversified client portfolio and we are willing to invest.
