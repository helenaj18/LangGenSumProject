 we report net sales of $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 representing our first full quarter of sales for the zyndranzetram (zyndranzetram ). 
 we are now approximately six months into the launch of zyndranzetram ( zyndranzetram ) and we have generated good momentum behind the launch driven by the unique product profile, the significant unmet need in third-line-plus lung cancer and the strong execution of our highly experienced team of sales and medical professionals. 
 we also continue to advance our pipeline that leverages our validated antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) platform applied to the treatment of solid tumors with high unmet medical need including platinum resistant ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer. 
 we also continue to evaluate zyndranzetram in combination with other agents in earlier line opportunities in third-line-plus lung cancer and as a single agent in follicular lymphoma.
