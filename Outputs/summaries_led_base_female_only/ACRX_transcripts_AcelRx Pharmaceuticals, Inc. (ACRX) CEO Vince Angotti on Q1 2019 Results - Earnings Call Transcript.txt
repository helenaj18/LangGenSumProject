 acelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRX ) reported first quarter 2019 financial results and provided an update on our commercial launch of dSUVIA in a press release. with me today are Vince Angotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pam Palmer, our Chief Medical Officer. 
 we continue to track to achieving 125 formulary approvals by the end of 2019 with a significant increase in approvals expected in the second half of the year. these formulary approvals remain the first gate to realizing commercial success. we are encouraged by the number of hospitals with whom we are having active discussions to bring DSUVIA on to their formularies. and in addition, we now have access to sell the product in over 300 ambulatory surgical centers. 
 since the launch in late February, we have spent a significant amount of time in the field speaking with healthcare providers and sharing the enthusiasm of our commercial organization in the early part of the launch. we believe that once this product is initially used, its applications in acute pain will be broadly accepted within healthcare settings, given its efficacy, safety and ease of use characteristics that benefit the patient, as well as the healthcare systems.
