 we report record third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $272 million and adjusted EBITDA of $280 million, respectively. 
 our results reflect double-digit growth in both our Construction Products and Engineered Structures segments, more than offsetting lower year-over-year results in our Transportation Products business.    
 we continue to see favorable market drivers in our Construction and Engineered Structures businesses supporting our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021 and into 2022.    
 finally, we discuss our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond.
