 the first quarter of 2022 was particularly exciting for our company because more patients were enrolled in the first clinical trial of ibezapolstat, our leading antibiotic candidate for the treatment of patients with acute acute c. difficile infection.    
 we are particularly excited about the impact of ibezapolstat on the microbiome and the impact of ibezapolstat on treating acute acute c. difficile infection on the microbiome.    
 we believe that ibezapolstat will be an exceptional long - term antibiotic for treating acute acute c. difficile infection and we look forward to building on this momentum as we look forward to the second half of 2022.
