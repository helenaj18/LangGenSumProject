the aclaris therapeutics ( n=19 ) quarterly earnings call is a transitional year in which we redefined our strategy and shifted our capital allocation to focus on our immuno-inflammatory pipeline. we reported positive results from the second of two pivotal phase 3 trials from common warts and if a-101 45% is approved, it has the potential to be the first FDA approved rx product for 101. we also reported positive results from our phase 1sd/ mad trial and we have recently completed our first in human single ascending and multiple ascending dose trial with ATI-450 in oral small molecule kinase inhibitor for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory diseases. we continue to advance our additional novel kinase inhibitors ATI-1777 and atii-2138, our covalently bound k+/txk/jak3 towards IND submissions. our current capital will provide a cash runway into the second quarter of 2021 without giving effect to any potential business development transactions or financing activities.
