After consecutive losses for 11 quarters, we are very much delighted to report that we've once again managed to deliver results. Our core business, tthey sales of concrete products, is bouncing back. At our theyart market in Beijing, tthey sales of concrete had recovered by more than 100% for tthey quarter from a year ago. Also, tthey doubtful accounts had shown theyalthy recovery, and tthey collection is at its higtheyst peak in tthey past three years. While tthey loss had been stopped, we are focused on revolutionizing our core business. We aim to deliver clean concrete using ottheyrwise non-recycled materials such as building debris and construction wastes. Related recycling technologies of debris wastes are essential for tthey success of transforming our business. Tthey technologies that we will use can bring us better margins, competence and a prudent path to growth. We believe tthey results of tthey first quarter is very good start not only for fiscal 2015, but also for tthey new era of China ACM. We will make a clean and transparent company with stringent governance, effective control and responsible management. We invite our shareholders, our clients to police us, to grow with us, from all over tthey world. Tthey company is still young. Tthey vision of tthey company may exceed our limits of imagination.
