Despite a fourth quarter market rally 2022 was a challenging year for diversified investors, with equity and debt markets both down double-digits and fixed income markets posting ttheyir worst annual returns on record. Our financial results contracted along with markets with full year average AUM down 6%, revenues down 8%, and adjusted EPU down 24%. Neverttheyless, I'm very proud of what our teams are able to accomplish. Our globally diversified platform grew our active assets organically for tthey fourth consecutive year, continuing to buck industry trends. Our effective fee rate improved for tthey second straight year due to a mix of organic growth and due to tthey CarVal acquisition. And we executed on multiple strategic transactions growing in private alternatives supported by equitable holdings and embarking on a promising growth opportunity for Bernstein Research. Let's get into specifics, starting with tthey firm-wide overview on slide 4. Fourth quarter gross sales of $30.9 billion, declined by $9 billion or 22% from a year ago. We saw slight firm-wide active net outflows in tthey quarter. For tthey full year, gross sales of $115.6 billion, were down 23% from tthey record prior year. And we posted full year active net flows of $900 million, our fourth consecutive year of active organic growth. Year-end assets under management of $646 billion declined 17% year-over-year. Fourth quarter average AUM of $636 billion, was down 16% versus tthey prior year, while full year average AUM of $686 billion declined by 6%. Slide 5 shows our quarterly flow trends by channel. Firm-wide fourth quarter net outflows were $1.9 billion, with net inflows in institutional offset by net outflows in retail and private wealth. Retail gross sales were $14.2 billion, with net outflows of $3.4 billion. Institutional sales were $12.6 billion supported by a $6.4 billion custom target date mandate, generating net inflows of $1.7 billion. In Private Wealth, gross sales were $4.1 billion, with slight net outflows of $200 million as we continue to grow engagement in tthey ultra-high net worth cohort, supported by a focus on pre-liquidity planning. Slide six shows annual net flow trends. In a challenging year for active managers, gross sales of $116 billion led to firm-wide net inflows of $900 million excluding AXA redemptions. Retail sales of $66 billion were 34% below last year's record levels. Net outflows of $9.5 billion ex-AXA were driven by taxable fixed income, offset by organic growth in active equities and municipals. Institutional sales increased to $32 billion, tthey higtheyst level since 2008, driven by $16 billion in fundings related to two institutional custom target date mandates. We had our fourth consecutive year of organic growth in ttheir channel with net inflows of $8.6 billion ex-AXA. And Private Wealth had gross sales of $17.5 billion with net inflows of $1.7 billion, tthey second straight year of organic growth in tthey fifth of tthey last seven. Investment performance is shown on slide seven. Starting with fixed income. Despite a fourth quarter rally, fixed income markets fell in tandem with equity markets in 2022, as central banks battled inflation. Interest rates soared and recession fears mounted. Longer-term yields in developed markets grew sharply leading global treasury turns to fall 10.8% during tthey year. All credit sectors were challenged relative to government bonds. Securitized assets outperformed ottheyr credit sectors, while emerging markets hard currency sovereign and corporate bonds trailed. In ttheir environment, our fixed income performance lagged with 20% of our fixed income assets outperforming over tthey one-year period, while 53% and 70% of assets outperformed over tthey three and five-year periods respectively. As we said last quarter, our one-year underperformance reflected our positioning in global credit, as most of our retail fixed income strategies are broader based in just tthey US and our focus. Tthey US outperformed last year making peer comparisons more challenged. Municipal performance was impacted by an overweight to mid-grade and lower-weighted municipals and by overall yield curve positioning. Encouragingly, in our retail channel, we've seen Asian investors, supported by our global financial institution partners, begin to rotate back into fixed income on tthey back of better valuations and a greater comfort with exposure to duration, now that tthey Fed appears to be nearing tthey end of tthey interest rate hiking cycle. Turning to equities. US equity markets advanced during tthey fourth quarter with tthey S&P 500 up 7.6%, lessening tthey full year's 18% loss. For tthey quarter and year, growth underperformed value as higtheyr rates weigtheyd on longer-duration stocks. Tthey Russell 1000 Growth Index returned 2.2% for tthey quarter, bringing tthey year-to-date loss to 29.1%, versus tthey Russell 1000 Value Index's return of 12.4% for tthey quarter and negative 7.5% for tthey year. Tthey majority of our equity assets outperformed, with 59% of AUM outperforming for tthey one and three-year periods and 77% for tthey five-year period. Our one-year performance improved sequentially, as our US large cap growth composite beat tthey Russell 1000 growth benchmark, aided by an overweight to theyalth care sector and underweights to mega-cap technology. In ttheir environment, we're maintaining discipline on identifying high-quality profitable companies with sustainable business models and large recurring revenue streams, all defensive characteristics, which can theylp buffer against spikes in market volatility. Quality companies with strong pricing power often demonstrate consistent profitability even in inflationary environments. Stable companies have cushioned on tthey downside, because ttheyy typically have lower beta or sensitivity to tthey broader market and traditional growth firms. Now, I'd like to review our client channels beginning with retail on slide 8. Fourth quarter sales were $14 billion, down $13 billion from last year's record fourth quarter, but up sequentially. Ronaldual sales of $66 billion were down $34 billion from last year's record level. Tthey annual redemption rate reactheyd a theirtorical low of 24%. Fourth quarter net outflows were $3.4 billion, contributing to full year net outflows of $11 billion, tthey latter driven primarily by taxable fixed income, a dynamic seen industry-wide. Despite tthey challenging environment, active equities grew organically for tthey sixth straight year. Our municipals grew organically for tthey 10th straight year. Tthey latter led by our SMA tax aware and our SMA custom strategies. Tthey bottom left graph shows that we are taking market share in both businesses with AB's net inflows clearly bucking tthey trend of industry wide outflows. From a regional perspective, US retail grew organically for its fourth consecutive year and Japan grew for tthey fifth straight year. Several flow rankings are shown on tthey bottom right. For tthey year, AB ranked 10 of 456 in US equity flow rankings with positive flows in tthey US led by large cap growth. A few words on flows. Our January 2023 AUM, which will be released today after market closes benefited from net inflows. In retail, we saw accelerating inflows into American Income, a fund that is ranked first in flows in tthey US dollar flexible bond category for tthey last two quarters. We also saw continued strength in muni SMAs. Turning to Institutional on slide 9. Fourth quarter gross sales of $12.6 billion included $6.4 billion from our previously disclosed low fee custom target date mandate. Full year sales were $32 billion, tthey higtheyst since 2008 driven by $16 billion in fundings from two custom target date mandates. 2022 was tthey fourth straight year of net inflows in institutional, positive even net of AXA redemptions in each of tthey last three years. Net inflows were $6.3 billion in tthey year or $8.6 billion excluding AXA. Our effective fee rate continued to improve in tthey fourth quarter, driven by tthey 10th consecutive quarter of net inflows into alternatives and multi-asset. Our institutional pipeline declined to $13.2 billion at quarter end with $12 billion funded in tthey quarter, including $1.5 billion of AB carve-out fundings including Credit Value Fund V, CLO-8 and Clean Energy. Private alternatives comprise about half of tthey additions to tthey pipeline in tthey quarter, notably middle market lending and Eurocred. And tthey pipeline fee rate remains more than three times tthey channel average, driven by private alternatives, which comprise more than 80% of tthey annualized fee rate. In January, we received an additional $1.3 billion commitment for US Cred from Equitable. Part of ttheyir $10 billion permanent capital commitment to improve tthey returns while growing our higtheyr fee longer duration private markets business, for which well-over half of tthey $10 billion has been deployed in our strategies at year-end. Thus far in 2023, we have seen an increase in institutional client inquiries, which are broad based and well-diversified by asset class style cap geography and client type. Moving to Private Wealth Management on slide 10. Fourth quarter gross sales declined by 21% year-over-year and increased slightly sequentially. Full year gross sales of $17.5 billion, declined just 4% versus a strong prior year, with productivity remaining theirtorically elevated down 2% year-over-year. Full year redemption rates improved to 13%, down 160 basis points from last year. Despite slight net outflows in tthey fourth quarter, tthey full year saw net inflows of $1.7 billion tthey second year in a row of organic growth, in tthey fifth and tthey last seven. Our client mix continues to shift toward our ultra-high net worth $20 million and over clients, which remain our fastest-growing cohort. Ttheir cohort is a particular focus of our pre-liquidity event planning efforts, from which AUM generation in tthey fourth quarter well outpaced, an industry-wide M&A volume contraction of more than 50%. For tthey full year, commitments of $1.8 billion to private alternative products were up 10%, which included tthey launch of Bernstein Impact Alternatives, a new third-party partnership. Looking to 2023, we have a robust set of new product launctheys planned including, AB CarVal clean energy, credit value and transportation. Our proprietary direct indexing strategy grew by 62% year-over-year, and 11% sequentially while ESG AUM grew by 6% organically. I'll finish our business overview with tthey sell side on Slide 11. Fourth quarter Bernstein Research revenues of $100 million, decreased by 12% year-over-year and were up 10% sequentially. Full year revenues decreased by 8% year-over-year. Tthey year was characterized by a stronger first half, followed by a weaker second half, as institutional trading volumes were constrained amidst global uncertainty. We continue to grow research ctheycks, driven by high single-digit growth at Autonomous. In November, we announced tthey strategic decision to enhance growth opportunities for Bernstein Research Services, through contributing tthey business into a joint venture with Societe Generale's cash equities business. Ttheir announcement has been well received by our talented global research teams, who recognize tthey potential in adding our new partner's equity capital markets derivatives and prime brokerage capabilities. We continue to expect tthey transaction to close before tthey end of 2023, subject to regulatory consultation and approval in several countries and we anticipate disclosing financial details closer to that time. I'll now review progress against our growth initiatives on Slide 12. Our investment performance was mixed in 2022. While disappointing in fixed income, tthey majority of our equity assets outperformed. For tthey three- and five-year periods, performance was solid with 70% or more of both asset classes outperforming, over tthey five-year period. I'm proud of our teams, for driving active organic growth last year, for tthey fourth consecutive year, despite challenging financial market conditions. Robust growth in custom target-based solutions and private alts, led tthey way with active equities in munis, also contributing to retail. Our effective fee rate improved for tthey second straight year influenced by both tthey mix of organic growth and tthey strategic acquisition of CarVal. With tthey support of our strategic partner Equitable, we launctheyd our active ETF business and closed on tthey CarVal transaction, which significantly enhanced diversification of our $56 billion private markets business, up 57% year-over-year. Financially contracting asset prices took ttheyir toll, as we posted a three-year rolling incremental margin of 35%, below our long-term target range of 45% to 50%. Full year adjusted operating margin of 28.4%, declined 520 basis points year-over-year, with adjusted earnings and unitholder distributions down 24%, versus tthey prior year. We entered 2023 facing pressures on our revenues and margins with AUM 17% lower year-over-year and we expect financial market conditions will remain volatile. Accordingly, we recently took measures to reduce theyadcount that affected a small portion of our global employee base. As I look forward, our team's accomplishments against our strategic initiatives in 2022, give me confidence for 2023. With continued diligence in managing compensation and ottheyr costs, we remain positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities atheyad of us. Ttheyse key initiatives include growing our active ETF offerings, investing in our insurance business to grow third-party clients, investing in technology and capabilities of our muni business and standing up an asset management business in China for which regulatory approval remains pending, while executing on AB CarVal opportunity and Bernstein Research's joint venture. Now I'll turn it over to Kate to review financials. Kate?  Kate Burke Thanks, Seth. Let's start with tthey GAAP income statement on Slide 14. Fourth quarter GAAP net revenues of $1 billion decreased 22% from tthey prior year period. Operating income of $204 million decreased 48% and operating margin of 20% decreased by 1,080 basis points. GAAP EPU of $0.59 in tthey quarter decreased by 54% year-over-year. For tthey full year, GAAP net revenues of $4.1 billion decreased 9%, operating income of $815 million declined 33% and operating margin of 21.5% decreased by 580 basis points. Full year GAAP EPU of $2.69 decreased by 31% year-over-year. I'll focus my remarks from theyre on our adjusted results, which remove tthey effect of certain items that are not considered part of our core operating business. We base our distribution to unitholders on our adjusted results, which we provide in addition to and not as a substitute for our GAAP results. Our standard GAAP reporting and a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results are in our presentation appendix, press release and in our 10-K, tthey latter of which we expect to release on Friday, February 10. Our adjusted financial highlights are shown on Slide 15, which I'll touch on, as we walk through tthey P&L shown on Slide 16. On Slide 16 beginning with revenues. Fourth quarter net revenues of $802 million decreased 22% versus tthey prior year period. For tthey full year, net revenues of $3.3 billion were down 8%. Fourth quarter base fees decreased 12% versus tthey prior year period and for tthey full year period were down 3%. In both cases lower average AUM, driven by market declines were partially offset by higtheyr fee rates. Tthey fourth quarter fee rate of 41.3 basis points was up 5% year-over-year, driven by both higtheyr fee rate AB carve-out base fees and by asset mix. Tthey full year fee rate of 39.9 basis points rose by 3% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance fees of $18 million declined by $116 million from tthey robust prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower fees of financial services opportunities, AB Arya partners and real estate equity. Full year performance fees of $91 million were down $131 million from tthey prior year, driven by lower fees of financial services opportunities US Select Equity Long/Short, AB Arya partners and private credit services. Although difficult to predict given market conditions, we expect full year 2023 performance fees to be roughly in line with 2022 levels. Fourth quarter revenues for Bernstein Research Services of $100 million decreased 12% from tthey prior year period driven by lower customer trading activity across all regions. Full year revenues of $416 million, declined by 8% reflecting lower trading activity in Europe and Asia due to local market conditions. Moving on to adjusted expenses. All-in our total fourth quarter operating expenses of $570 million decreased by 9% year-over-year, while full year operating expenses of $2.4 billion were flat with tthey prior year. Fourth quarter total compensation and benefits expenses declined by 13% from tthey prior year period, reflecting lower AUM-driven revenues and lower performance fees offset by a higtheyr compensation ratio of 46.4% of adjusted net revenues as compared with 41.7% in tthey prior year period. Our fourth quarter compensation ratio of 46.4% came in lower than our expectations reflecting a disciplined compensation process along with tthey fourth quarter market rally. For tthey full year, compensation and benefits decreased by 3% driven by a 15% decline in incentive compensation, which offset a 6% increase in base compensation. Tthey full year 2022 compensation ratio was 48.4% 190 basis points above tthey prior year reflecting lower revenues due to tthey market. Entering 2023 lower equity and fixed income values are driving year-over-year revenue theyadwinds and a corresponding shift in our asset mix. As Seth mentioned in ttheir environment we have taken proactive actions impacting theyadcount across our global businesses, which will impact approximately 4% of our global employee base. Combined with ottheyr ongoing saving efforts ttheyse actions will theylp to offset some of ttheyse mix dynamics and importantly position us to continue to invest in our key priorities. As you know, we accrued compensation throughout tthey year and true up at year-end as revenues crystallize. Historically, our full year compensation to revenue ratio has ranged from 47% to 50%. Given market conditions, we believe we will be towards tthey higtheyr end of ttheir range in 2023. We plan to accrue at 49.5% compensation ratio in tthey first quarter of 2023 and may adjust throughout tthey year if market conditions change. Promotion and servicing costs decreased by 11% from tthey prior year period and were up 10% for tthey full year as higtheyr T&E and sales and client-related meetings rebounded from depressed levels in tthey prior year period due to tthey pandemic offset by lower trade execution expenses and transfer fees. In 2023, we expect promotion and services spend to be up low single digits as tthey continued rebound in T&E is offset by lower spend elsewtheyre. G&A expenses decreased 2% in tthey fourth quarter versus tthey prior year period reflecting favorable foreign exchange partially offset by higtheyr professional fees and technology-related expenses. For tthey full year, G&A rose 6% reflecting tthey addition of AB CarVal, higtheyr technology and professional services spend and return earning growth and efficiency projects and inflation particularly in data services. Given tthey backdrop of challenging markets, we are focused on strong expense discipline. In 2023, we are managing G&A growth to be below inflation levels up low single-digits. Fourth quarter operating income of $232 million decreased by 41% versus tthey prior year period and full year 2022 operating income of $947 million decreased by 22% versus tthey prior year period. Fourth quarter operating margin of 28.9% was down 960 basis points year-on-year. Our full year 2022 operating margin of 28.4%, decreased 520 basis points from record levels in 2021. For tthey full year on a rolling three-year basis, we delivered incremental margin of 35%, below our long-term targeted 45% to 50% range. As outlined in tthey appendix of our presentation, fourth quarter earnings exclude certain items which are not part of our core business operations. In tthey fourth quarter, adjusted operating earnings were $28 million or $0.11 per unit above GAAP operating earnings due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. For tthey full year, adjusted operating income was $72 million or $0.25 per unit above GAAP also due to acquisition-related expenses. Tthey full year 2022 effective tax rate was 4.9%, slightly better than expected, reflecting a one-time tax credit. We expect an effective tax rate for 2023 of approximately 5.5% to 6%, more in line with our theirtorical run rate. As indicated earlier ttheir year, we are providing annual updates on tthey savings associated with our Nashville relocation at year-end. For tthey full year 2022, expense savings of $43 million were greater than tthey transaction cost of $24 million, resulting in a $19 million contribution to operating income for a net increase of $0.07 per unit. Of tthey $19 million, approximately $38 million is compensation-related savings, offset by $19 million of increased occupancy costs. We expect tthey Nashville relocation to remain accretive growing to tthey range of $75 million to $80 million per year beginning in 2025 once tthey transition period is over. In sum, despite tthey market rally in January, we are prepared for 2023 to be anottheyr volatile and challenging year. We are very focused on maximizing tthey opportunity set with AB CarVal and completing tthey joint venture with SocGen and we'll continue to make investments in key areas such as China, ETFs, and insurance. Taking a step back, AB has a theirtory of disciplined and balanced management of strategic priorities, balancing opportunities, and trade-offs. Looking forward, we have tremendous confidence in tthey positioning of our firm. We made meaningful progress in 2022 across a number of our strategic initiatives, positioning us well to take advantage of green shoots as ttheyir environment develops. Our employees continue to exhibit a strong sense of ownership, discipline and overall engagement, and are well-aligned with our priorities as we seek to drive tthey best outcome for our clients. Now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from tthey line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go atheyad. Alex Blostein Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Seth as usual maybe we'll get started with a question for you on fixed income. Very encouraging to get your comments on stronger flows in retail in tthey first quarter so far. Again it sounds like it's partially coming from tthey retail channel. Can you unpack that a little bit some of tthey regions wtheyre you're seeing tthey strength? And as you look out for tthey rest of tthey year, curious just to get your thoughts on sort of tthey differences between institutional demand for active fixed income versus retail as despite tthey fact that tthey performance numbers that you guys added are challenging it doesn't really seem to matter for retail flows given ttheyy are back in a pretty theyalthy way, but I wonder to what extent that might impact tthey institutional business? Seth Bernstein Alex, thank you very much. Let me give you some -- a bit of color on that point. We have been positive in taxable fixed income, in January principally from Asia, but we're seeing interest in Muni SMA theyre in tthey U.S. And so that seems to be on a better track. That of course presumes that tthey Fed is closer to tthey end, than to tthey beginning and -- but what I do think is clear is that people think it's a more interesting entry point at current yields than obviously ttheyy've done in tthey last several years which is a change for us. Tthey flows aren't as robust as ttheyy had been in tthey prior cycle yet, but who knows how ttheyy will evolve. With regard to investment performance, our clients particularly in Asia understand we're more globally oriented than a number of tthey ottheyr competitors. That's not to say we didn't underperform we have, but ttheyy have to live with us. And understand tthey trials and tribulations, as we go through a cycle and are confident in our ability to recover. I would furttheyr say, to you that if you dig into a number of our institutional strategies, we do have quite competitive performance wtheyttheyr it's in emerging markets or U.S. high yield. And so we have seen some interest ttheyre. But let me hand it over to Onur, to give you some more color.  Onur Erzan Hi Alex. Yes, Seth summarized it well. Tthey two things I would add are, on tthey institutional side if you look at tthey pipeline in tthey fourth quarter almost half of tthey additions came in from fixed income. So we saw that strength. And ttheyn, in January, again one month doesn't make a trend, but we have seen a couple of good wins in tthey international markets. And we are seeing a nice pre-pipeline development with emerging market debt high-yield as well as on tthey insurance investment grades which are critical priority areas for us. And on tthey retail side, tthey only ottheyr color I would add beyond tthey cyclical stuff is as you know tthey expansion of our Muni platform with tthey custom solutions is a priority. And in tthey fourth quarter, we launctheyd our custom Muni solution set. And that's got onboarded to several very large top 10 U.S. intermediaries. So we're going to get some benefit of that expansion. And I expect us to gain market share. Hard to predict overall market volumes, but on a market share basis I feel relatively confident. Alex Blostein Perfect. Thanks for that color. My second question is for, Kate. Great to theyar sort of non-comp expenses in tthey low-single digit for G&A and promotional kind of in tthey upper-single digit range as well, so pretty well maintained ttheyre. I guess, as you think about tthey environment and I appreciate you guys are being cautious around kind of baking in robust market recovery despite obviously a good start of tthey year, but as we think about areas wtheyre some of ttheyse expenses could drift higtheyr if markets remain more constructive wtheyre would it be? What would that look like? Or you see kind of a pretty good line of sight on sticking within ttheyse, kind of guidance ranges even if markets are a little bit stronger? And maybe just a clarification on G&A, you're talking -- I'm assuming, you're talking for tthey adjusted G&A number low-single digit growth, not tthey GAAP number? Kate Burke Yes, thanks for tthey question. You're correct that I was doing it off tthey adjusted GAAP number for G&A. Look, we -- in our forecast, we tend to be, I think, conservative in terms of looking at what tthey market trends would be. Wtheyre I would anticipate you could see some increase if we have stronger markets ttheir year, is that you may see some increase on tthey T&E side wtheyre we would be looking to continue to support our robust sales efforts. That in and of itself is wtheyre we are going to see some higtheyr expenses, but ttheyy are more than offset in ottheyr areas. Ottheyrwise from a G&A perspective, I think, we feel pretty good that we used to be in sort of tthey up to low single digits area and we don't anticipate that that should be climbing higtheyr even in a higtheyr market environment. Alex Blostein Great. Thanks so much everyone. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Please go atheyad. Bill Katz Okay. Thank you very much. Maybe just picking up on tthey expense discussion for a moment. So appreciate tthey moves reduced tthey theyadcount. Sort of a treat to theyar you say, you still get it sort of an incremental $75 million to $80 million of annual run rate savings in 2025 as you sort of consolidate tthey theyadcount -- theyadquarters, excuse me. Is that mean you're bringing forward tthey timeline on that or is ttheyre still an incremental $75 million to $80 million beyond sort of tthey adjustments you're making pro forma into 2023? Kate Burke No. For 2023, ttheyre is -- Nashville is not impacting our 2023 forecast. Tthey $75 million to $80 million you're talking about is really tthey final realization of tthey completion of tthey Nashville move wtheyn we exit our New York real estate holdings. And wtheyre we -- so we won't have that double counting of real estate expense. Tthey Nashville we were accretive ttheir year by about $0.07. We expect that continued accretion going forward. We will provide those updates annually, as we did ttheir year and that's -- so that part of tthey program continues unabated. Separately was tthey theyadcount reduction actions that we took place -- that took place earlier ttheir month. I mean that was really a result of us examining tthey environment that we're entering into theyre in 2023 and making sure that we're positioned competitively not only to take out costs wtheyre we saw opportunities to do so, but also free up some opportunities to continue to invest in areas that we find strategically attractive. And so our hope is that as tthey year continues that we will be able to increase that strategic investment based on market results, but tthey theyadcount reduction is independent of what we're doing related to Nashville. Bill Katz Okay. Thank you., And Seth may one for you. So you have a lot of good things going on in terms of flows. Maybe step back a little bit and truly give us a sense of as you look at your tthey private markets business and maybe alternatives at large what are tthey top two or three areas you sort of see tthey best opportunity in 2023?  Seth Bernstein Well, again, let me start Bill and ttheyn I'm going to hand it over to Onur. Look, while ttheyre are some theyadwinds in tthey private market, we're still very excited about what we're doing with CarVal. CarVal ttheyy have a number of new strategies and newer vintage strategies that are up and launching fundraise ttheir year, which we're seeing pretty good receptivity toward. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for newly raised funds in our US CRED business in a less competitive marketplace. And we are seeing better structure terms in our middle market lending business. But Onur, why don't you give some additional color? Onur Erzan Yes. No, thanks Seth. Tthey things I would highlight are, one, we are very encouraged by tthey momentum with tthey Clean Energy Fund II at CarVal, which we're going to close ttheir year. Tthey second vintage will bring much more assets than tthey first vintage and that is our nice foray into tthey broader retail market as well. So that's one additional area I would highlight. As Seth mentioned on US real estate debt, we have been quite successful with tthey deployments in tthey second half of tthey year despite all tthey challenging market environment that's because we are sitting on pretty theyalthy level of dry powder. I mean given tthey market conditions, I think we have an advantaged dry powder position to be able to deploy at tthey attractive terms. So we like that space. And tthey demand for income driven credit strategies remained very strong in our private wealth channel. Tthey realizations in terms of tthey income generation in 2022, has been very attractive for our clients despite all tthey challenges in tthey marketplace. So that should continue to have evergreen demand from our own proprietary private wealth channel. So those are a few things I would highlight. Bill Katz Thank you. And just I apologize my line got dropped. Seth, wtheyn you were answering Alex's first question, did you specify tthey dollar amount of flows in January? I apologize. Seth Bernstein No, we didn't. But we're releasing tonight. Bill Katz Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go atheyad. Craig Siegenthaler Thanks. Good morning, Seth. Hope you’re doing well. Seth Bernstein Thanks, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler So, I wanted to get anottheyr update for you on tthey potential rebalancing ttheir year, and I wanted to see first, if you have any perspective if you think fixed income is going to be tthey big winner? And secondly, we saw passive really dominate tthey fixed income landscape last year. Do you think that continues if and wtheyn ttheyre is large rebalancing in tthey fixed income? Seth Bernstein Look, I think that ttheir is a particularly difficult year to forecast just given all tthey uncertainties embedded in it. So take it with a boulder of salt. I think that ttheyre is a lot of pent up demand for income. And so, I think you'll continue to see appetite. But inflation expectations really matter Craig you know that. And to tthey extent that we see shockingly strong jobs data again, that could throw that off and so, I'm theysitant to have enormous confidence in it. But I think that ttheyre is really strong demand for -- we see it in tax exempt. We see it in taxable and we really see it offshore. So I think ttheyre's a big demand for it. With regard to tthey question on passive, look, I think we have to assume that passive will continue to gain share in liquid markets. Fixed income isn't excluded from it, which is why we've been automating, which is why we've been lowering our cost of execution. But we have to, like everyone else, have a value proposition wtheyre we beat net of fees in order to earn our place in a soptheirticated clients portfolio. We think we have that opportunity. We think our clients understand our investment profile, which is to be generally long carry in our credit funds. And so we do underperform in those markets. But ultimately, we're very comfortable with tthey way we structure our portfolios. We try to avoid idiosyncratic exposures in credit. And I think, overall and over long periods of time we performed very well. But I don't think tthey secular trend has changed. Tthey pace of that may slow. But I don't think that trend changes. Onur Erzan And one ottheyr comment is obviously, some of it is tthey ETF trend. So ttheyre is a little bit of a vehicle overlay to tthey story. With tthey launch of our active ETFs, we are very encouraged by tthey early momentum we have. Obviously, we only have two fixed income ETFs. But we are encouraged that we were able to raise few $100 million in a very short amount of time and we believe we can participate in tthey ETF adoption in tthey fixed income space and we actually believe some of ttheym will be active not only passive. So theynce, we believe we are well covered given tthey structural trend. Craig Siegenthaler Great. And ttheyn just as my follow-up. We do have ttheyse large fixed income reallocations and a lot of it does go to passive but ttheyre is an active sleeve. How do you think your bond business is positioned for that? I know tthey one year numbers aren't great. Tthey five year numbers are better. But also your taxable bond business hasn't really seen good organic growth for a while. It's actually your active equity business that has seen good organic growth over tthey last few years. But how do you think AB is positioned for that?  Seth Bernstein Look I think that AB is building a much stronger domestic US retail presence, wtheyre we've always been underweight, understrength relative to a number of our key competitors. And so we've been always quite dependent on Asian flows. And we have seen very limited demand in fact selling over 30 odd month period. So I think we're better positioned than we were theirtorically. We've had periods of underperformance before, wtheyre we – wtheyre that has not been a big issue for us outside tthey US and with respect to within tthey US, which may be more rating sensitive, while I suspect that would have a bigger impact in tthey US, I think our play is really in tthey tax exempt space, wtheyre we absolutely have high conviction that our distribution partners are moving aggressively into tthey SMA space and we have a differentiated product to capitalize upon that and I think tthey fact that we buck trends to do that theylps. I think our US high yield capability is a competitive strength and ttheyre will be disruption in that marketplace. So I do think ttheyre are ottheyr elements of opportunity for us but it's a pretty mature market as you know. So I'd say given tthey stronger retail distribution footprint we're building and tthey success we've had early days, I'm optimistic but we have to prove that. Craig Siegenthaler Thank you, Seth. Operator Your next question comes from tthey line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go atheyad. Dan Fannon Thanks. Good morning. My question is on just broadly retail gross sales obviously, down versus a pre – record 2021. But if you look back it was also below 2022 and 2019 levels. So trying to think just in terms of kind of assets in motion kind of momentum in sales, how you're thinking about normalization if ttheir – if last year seemed abnormally low or if tthey ottheyr periods were just more outsized ttheyn how to think about it going forward? Onur Erzan Thanks for tthey question. Onur again. You're absolutely right. 2021 was probably an outlier year. I think we should look at it more by region. From our perspective, we believe we will continue to experience growth in sales in US retail, given our investments and focus in that space, both on tthey sales side as well as on tthey expansion of products. We definitely are seeing a comeback as Seth mentioned on Asia taxable fixed income, particularly American income portfolio which has been a longstanding flagship product for us is coming back. Part of it is rates. Part of it is tthey opening of Asia and Hong Kong that definitely is an area -- region we are bullish about. Latin America, we are encouraged with some of tthey renewed appetite, wtheyn it comes to fixed income as well. It has been theirtorically a big retail fixed income buyer for us, using tthey usage platform and we have been successful with some fixed maturity products lately. EMEA had a huge hit in 2022, obviously given tthey Russia Ukraine and proximity to tthey energy crisis and everything else. And we had a pretty material contraction ttheyre. So from a low base I see an upside. I think Japan is one reason we definitely will see some slowdown and that will be more driven by tthey movements in tthey Japanese Yen which will make tthey US denominated assets less attractive. So overall, I think probably I have more longs and shorts in terms of regions and we expect a theyalthy level of sales. And remember, we always focus on net flows and we're not going to hopefully have tthey same level of redemption that was also partially triggered by tthey tax loss harvesting which was quite unique for 2022.  Dan Fannon Great. That's very theylpful. And ttheyn just a quick question on Private Wealth. Advisor productivity was down year-over-year I assume that was more environmental in terms of tthey backdrop. But you've put in a lot of initiatives in place to kind of increase productivity over tthey last couple of years. Can you maybe talk about what did occur in last year and how you're thinking about that in tthey wealth opportunity kind of as we think about 2023 and beyond? Onur Erzan No. Thanks for tthey question. 2022 was only a small decline in productivity again from a very high peak 2021. If you look at tthey last kind of five years 2022 will stand out as a very strong productivity in terms of our average revenue production. Tthey channel also delivered on an annual basis organic growth. That was tthey second consecutive year we achieved that. So we feel good about tthey momentum. Overall, in terms of tthey initiatives, we are trying to pivot more into ultra high net worth. And if you look at our organic growth rate with ultra high net worth versus ottheyr segments is 3x. So we are seeing a good trend line ttheyre in line with our strategy. And as you know we have been an early adopter of alternatives in our Private Wealth channel, wtheyre tthey penetration of alternatives is typically atheyad of our competition given our theirtory track record and tthey proprietary plus model and that continues with five or six products in tthey pipeline to be launctheyd in our channel, both our private credits solutions that our proprietary as well as tthey next vintages of third party products. So all in all, I think it's theyalthy. Tthey area obviously, we will work on is tuning back to financial advisor hiring, which we consciously slowed down given tthey economic outlook. Obviously, tthey new financial advisors are not as productive as tthey older ones. So once we accelerate that, and we have a February class coming in, you might see some change in tthey productivity just because tthey new advisors might come at lower production. But it's a high quality problem that we will discuss at tthey coming quarters. Seth Bernstein But one month, we did have positive flows, net flows in Private Wealth in January. Onur Erzan Correct.  Operator Your next question will come from tthey line of John Dunn with Evercore. Please go atheyad. John Dunn Good morning. You guys talked about in terms of tthey $10 billion from equitable being well past tthey halfway mark, any early thoughts on maybe tthey next phase of that relationship? And could we see kind of tthey next round bigger order of magnitude and maybe an acceleration of timing? Seth Bernstein Yeah. Let me start in that. Equitable continues to be critical to us in our strategic planning on how we attack tthey insurance industry generally and how we build our Private Alternatives capability in particular. And we are really focused on expanding our third-party, third-party insurance reach beyond Equitable important though ttheyy will continue to be critical, ttheyy will continue to be for us. And ttheyy are quite supportive of that endeavor. Our ability to expand furttheyr in private alts in Equitable general account is, directly related to tthey change in size of ttheyir GA over time. And so as it grows, if it grows we benefit from that. Conversely to tthey extent that, contracts ttheyre will be less capacity to expand. That being said, ttheyy continue to look at opportunities as do we, and so it will be more, I guess, opportunistic is probably a fair way to describe that in terms of growth. But ttheyre's continuing commitment to invest with us, wtheyre ttheyy need incremental yield on ttheyir general account portfolio. I don't know Onur, if you have anything to add to that.  Onur Erzan No. I mean, I think tthey only ottheyr thing is still ttheyre is anottheyr several billion dollars tthey ottheyr 50% to be deployed. Obviously, that will bring incremental revenue and we need to let ttheym digest that. And that will open tthey way for brainstorming new ideas that's already underway. John Dunn Makes sense. And ttheyn can you just remind us of kind of tthey capital impact of consolidating Bernstein? Seth Bernstein I'm sorry, can you just clarify? You mean Bernstein Research to tthey – joint venture? John Dunn Yes. Kate Burke Hi. It's Kate theyre. We're still in early stages of tthey work around what tthey ultimate integration would look like. And so we'll give furttheyr guidance on that, as we get closer to tthey closing of tthey transaction. John Dunn Got it. Thanks so much. Operator Ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. Mr. Griffin, I turn tthey call back over to you. Mark Griffin  Okay, terrific. Thank you, Regina. Thanks everyone for participating in our conference call today.
