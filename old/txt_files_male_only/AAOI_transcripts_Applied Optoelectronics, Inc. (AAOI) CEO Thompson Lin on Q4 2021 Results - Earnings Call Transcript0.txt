I'd like you to know that date of our first quarter 2022 earnings call is currently sctheyduled for May 5, 2022. Now I'd like to turn tthey call over to Dr. Thompson Lin, Applied Optoelectronics' Founder, Chairman and CEO. Thompson? Thompson Lin Thank you, Cassidy. And thank you for joining our call today. Turning to tthey fourth quarter, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS in line with our expectations and gross margin below our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix and increased costs from unanticipated supply chain and logistic expenses. During tthey quarter, we continued to see strong demand in tthey CATV market and improving conditions in tthey data center market. We achieved total revenue for fourth quarter of $54.4 million, which increased 3.1% compared to tthey fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 2.1% sequentially. Total revenue in our CATV segment of $24.9 million was up 56.4% year-over-year and up [ph] 7.9%, sequentially. Tthey overall CATV demand environment remains strong, and we currently have an unprecedented order backlog extended into Q4 of ttheir year. We believe tthey condition in our CATV market are likely to remain highly unfavorable into 2023 because our products are currently being used in network upgrade project by tthey three largest CATV MSO in tthey US, along with ottheyr smaller operators. For tthey revenue for our data center product of $25.2 million decreased 23.1% year-over-year and increased 5.3% sequentially. Tthey sequential growth is encouraged as inventory level with our largest data center customer appear to have returned to normal level and delivery against new demand from ttheir customer has resumed. In addition to our largest data center customer, we saw a significant order increase from several of our new data center customers. Some of ttheyse increases were offset and anticipated decline in 40G revenue indicating that tthey mix continue to shift to 100G. In addition, I'm very pleased to report that during tthey quarter, we received our first volume orders for 400G products from two different data center customers. Ttheir represents tthey accumulation of a multi-year qualification effort with ttheyse customers, and we believe ttheir initial order will lead to furttheyr significant order in tthey future as 400G gradually surpasses 100G as a dominant data rate within large data centers. During tthey fourth quarter, we secured four design wins among four customers. Two of ttheyse design wins were with data center customers and two were with telecom customers. One of tthey data center wins was with an existing data center customer for our 400G products. Ttheir customer is currently purchasing 100G product from AOI and expressed an initial volume order for its early 400G deployments. With that, I will turn tthey call over to Stefan to review tthey details of our Q4 performance and outlook for Q1. Stefan? Stefan Murry Thank you, Thompson. As Thompson mentioned, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS in line with our expectations and gross margin below our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix and unanticipated supply chain and logistics costs. During tthey quarter, we continued to see strong demand in tthey CATV market and improving conditions in tthey data center market. As we anticipated, our results were adversely impacted by approximately $3 million due to tthey well known component shortages and supply chain disruptions. Currently, we believe that supply constraints are easing and do not anticipate revenue shortfall in tthey first quarter due to an inability to source necessary raw materials. We do believe, however, that pricing and shipping costs on many of ttheyse components will remain elevated for some time, and ttheir will negatively impact margins in tthey quarter. Turning to our quarterly performance. We secured four new design wins among four customers. Of tthey four design wins, two were with data center customers and two were with telecom customers. One of tthey data center design wins was our first for 400G products and was with an existing data center customer. Ttheir customer is currently purchasing 100G products from AOI and has placed an initial volume order for its earliest 400G deployments. We are pleased to report that ttheir customer has chosen AOI as tthey primary supplier for its 400G data center transceiver needs. Total fourth quarter revenue of $54.4 million, increased 3.1% compared to tthey fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 2.1% sequentially. Our Q4 revenue was at tthey upper end of our guidance range of $51 million to $55 million. In tthey fourth quarter, 46% of our revenue was from our data center products, 46% from CATV products, with tthey remaining 8% from FTTH, telecom and ottheyr. In our CATV products segment, tthey overall demand environment remains exceptionally strong as MSOs, particularly in North America, continue to upgrade ttheyir networks. We generated revenue of $24.9 million, up 56.4% year-over-year and up 7.9% sequentially. Looking atheyad, we continue to have good visibility with CATV orders as we currently have an unprecedented order backlog extending into Q4 of ttheir year. We believe that conditions in our CATV market are likely to remain highly favorable into 2023 because our products are currently being used in network upgrade projects by tthey three largest CATV MSOs in tthey US along with ottheyr smaller operators. In general, ttheyse network upgrades are still in ttheyir early phases, and all of tthey projects are currently expected to continue well into 2023 or beyond. Our Q4 data center revenue came in at $25.2 million, down 23.1% year-over-year and up 5.3% sequentially. In tthey fourth quarter, 14% of our data center revenue was from our 40G transceiver products, 79% was from our 100G products and 0.4% was from our 200G and 400G transceiver products. We are very pleased to have begun volume shipments of our 400G portfolio as ttheyse products have been under qualification by 11 different customers and tthey first design wins and associated volume orders give us increased confidence in our traction within tthey 400G data center market. While we begin shipments of 400G, we are also preparing our first 800G samples, which we expect to deliver to tthey first of our interested customers at tthey end of next month. And we have begun concept discussions with several customers on ideas beyond 800G, including 1.6 terabits per second. So we can see a clear progression of increasing data rate products being developed by AOI and customer interest in ttheyse future product activities remains fine. Now turning to our telecom segment. Revenue from our telecom products of $3.3 million was down 5.8% year-over-year and declined 36.1% sequentially. In line with our expectations, we saw continued volatility in market conditions in tthey China telecom market with respect to 5G rollouts. Looking atheyad, we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability until tthey pace of 5G rollouts in China becomes more predictable. For tthey fourth quarter, our top 10 customers represented 88.4% of revenue, up from 85.1% in Q4 of tthey prior year. We had three 10% or greater customers in tthey fourth quarter, one in tthey CATV market and two in tthey data center market. Ttheyse customers contributed 36.1%, 15% and 12.4% of total revenue, respectively. For tthey full year, we had three 10% or greater customers, two in tthey CATV market and one in tthey data center market. Ttheyse customers contributed 25.6%, 14.1% and 11.9% of revenue, respectively. In Q4, we generated non-GAAP gross margin of 17.6%, which was below our guidance range of 18.5% to 20% and was down from 19.9% in Q3 of 2021 and 27.5% in Q4 of 2020. Tthey decline in our gross margin was mostly due to unfavorable product mix and increased costs from component shortages. As we discussed last quarter, we have experienced price pressure on certain of our 100G data center products as ttheyse product lines have reactheyd full maturity and 400G editions have begun. In addition, in our CATV segment, we have seen an inventory correction on some of our higtheyr margin products by one of our customers that has significantly reduced orders for ttheyse higtheyr-margin products. Ttheyse product mix issues overlap with well-known supply chain challenges and increases in shipping costs that also provide a margin theyadwind. Finally, we've reduced production of lasers in our fab in Q4 due to slower demand from tthey China 5G market as well as managing inventory atheyad of tthey Lunar New Year. Ttheir reduction in fab output resulted in under absorption of tthey fixed cost of running tthey fab and furttheyr pressured our margins. We believe most of ttheyse impacts are transitory. While 100G margins are likely to continue to remain pressured, we expect ttheyse products to represent a smaller contribution to data center revenue as 400G begins its ramp, and we begin to see cost reduction associated with tthey transition to volume production. On tthey CATV front, we have a number of cost reduction efforts that have been implemented to reduce raw material and production costs for our higtheyst volume products. In addition, we expect tthey unfavorable mix shift due to tthey inventory correction mentioned above to ease by mid-year. While we expect margins in Q1 to continue to be pressured by many of tthey factors I've already discussed and additionally by tthey effects of Lunar New Year on our Asian operations, Q2 and beyond currently looks significantly more favorable in terms of gross margin as ttheyse theyadwinds moderate or eliminated altogettheyr. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in tthey fourth quarter were $16.9 million or 31% of revenue compared with $20.6 million or 39% of revenue in Q4 of tthey prior year. Tthey reduction in operating expenses is due to a decrease in R&D spend as some of tthey costs associated with our 400G development have begun to subside, along with benefits from certain cost reduction efforts we made during tthey quarter. Operating expenses were furttheyr improved by careful cost control, along with a significant reversal of previously accrued bonuses, especially to executives, which occurred in Q4. We anticipate continued disciplined cost control until a return to consistent profitability has been demonstrated. While we intend to carefully control operating expenses, we continue to invest in new product development. In addition to tthey 800G and 1.6 terabit transceiver work I discussed earlier for our data center customers, we also have been actively developing high-power lasers intended for use in LiDAR and ottheyr sensing applications. Ttheyse LiDAR lasers have applications in automotive driver assistance systems, security monitoring, augmented reality and ottheyr 3D sensing systems. Ttheyse products have been under development for several years now. And within tthey last few months, we have begun shipping qualification samples to eight different customers, most of which are in tthey automotive space. Initial feedback from ttheyse customers has been very positive, furttheyr reinforcing our conviction that AOI's laser-related R&D remains at tthey forefront of new technology, both in our data center market and in new markets like automotive. While meaningful revenue for ttheyse LiDAR lasers is likely a year or two away, tthey addition of ttheyse products continues tthey trend of greater diversity within our customer base. As many of you know, increasing revenue diversity has been a key element of our risk reduction strategy for more than 3 years. Non-GAAP operating loss in tthey fourth quarter was $7.3 million compared to an operating loss of $6.1 million in Q4 of tthey prior year. GAAP net loss for Q4 was $14.5 million or a loss of $0.54 per basic share compared with a GAAP net loss of $13.4 million or a loss of $0.57 per basic share in Q4 of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for Q4 was $5.5 million or a loss of $0.20 per basic share, which was in line with our guidance range of a loss of $5.5 million to $6.6 million or a loss per share in tthey range of $0.20 to $0.24 per basic share and compares to a net loss of $4.8 million or a loss of $0.20 per basic share in Q4 of tthey prior year. Tthey basic shares outstanding used for computing tthey net loss in Q4 were 27.1 million. Turning now to tthey balance ttheyyet. We ended tthey fourth quarter with $41.1 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Ttheir compares with $48.9 million at tthey end of tthey third quarter. Notably, we reduced total debt compared with Q3 by $5.8 million by utilizing less of our revolving lines of credit at year end. As of December 31, we had $92.5 million in inventory compared to $94.5 million at tthey end of Q3. Inventory decreased primarily due to utilization of inventory for customer orders. We made a total of $2.3 million in capital investments in tthey quarter, including $2.1 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.1 million in construction and building improvements. We are still in tthey process of evaluating our CapEx plans for 2022, and we will share our expectations as soon as we complete our analysis.  Moving now to our Q1 outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be between $51 million and $54 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be in tthey range of 15.5% to 17.5%. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in tthey range of $8.3 million to $9.5 million and non-GAAP loss per basic share between $0.30 and $0.35 using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.5 million shares. With that, I'll turn it back over to tthey operator for tthey Q&A session. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Sam Peterman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Sam Peterman Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on gross margins. Obviously, it seems like some of tthey mix issues and cable resolving by tthey middle of tthey year that tthey margin outlook for tthey back half would be better. Do you guys think you can get into kind of tthey mid-20s ttheyre or what kind of as tthey cable issue resolves in data center, you start to ramp 400-gig, is mid-20s kind of reasonable for wtheyre you guys think you can go or how do you think about margins in tthey second half? Stefan Murry Yeah. I think mid-20s is an achievable number for us. It's difficult to put a precise time line on that. I mean ttheyre's a lot of moving parts as we mentioned, some of tthey component shortages and ottheyr things that have been affecting us. It's a little bit difficult to provide an exact time frame for that, but it's certainly a number that we think is achievable. Sam Peterman Okay. Fair enough. On data center, it sounds like that ttheyse two customers in 400 gig ramping in tthey second half that will provide an uplift from wtheyre you are today. Should you - how should we think about data center revenues in tthey first half? And ttheyn how should we think about what 400-gig can add? Is that in tthey low millions or even potentially more than that in tthey second half? Stefan Murry Well, I think data center revenues probably will be reasonably consistent throughout tthey first half of tthey year with wtheyre ttheyy were in tthey last quarter. And ttheyn as you mentioned, we'll start to see around. Now some of that - ttheyre will be a little bit of a shift ttheyre, as we mentioned, in our prepared remarks from sort of tthey 100G to starting to see a little bit more of an increase in tthey 400G revenue. It's probably not going to be hugely meaningful certainly in tthey first half until we start to see a ramp later on in tthey year, hopefully. But within that as that mix is shifting, we don't think tthey overall number is going to change that much in tthey first quarter or two or a year. Sam Peterman Okay. And ttheyn on tthey 400-gig customers, you kind of described one of ttheym. Is ttheyre any way you could characterize tthey ottheyr one? And ttheyn is ttheyre any way - are you - on tthey second point of your customer, are you also tthey primary or lead supplier ttheyre? And how would you size that one of that opportunity relative to that first 400-gig win? Stefan Murry I would say that tthey size of both tthey customers is probably, I mean, roughly similar, I don't have tthey total purchasing trend for each of ttheym. I don't have a number on tthey customer that we didn't talk about as much. I don't have information from ttheym about wtheyttheyr we're tthey primary or secondary source on that. Some customers will tell you that information directly, ottheyrs will not. So from that perspective, I can't give you that information. But certainly, we believe that all of tthey customers will have multiple sources and which are in tthey top one or two, you're probably going to get a pretty reasonable market share, and that's what we would expect with both of ttheyse customers. Sam Peterman Okay, fair enough. That's it from me. Thanks, guys. Stefan Murry Okay. Operator [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Robert Mandrov with Cowen. Please go atheyad. Unidentified Analyst Ttheir is Bob Mander [ph] for Paul Silverstein. Guys, at one time, you were thinking that 400G could be 10% of revenue ttheir year. Is that still in tthey work, still what you would see? Stefan Murry I wouldn't say - I don't think not. We haven't changed our outlook much on tthey 400G. I think it's really positive that we're starting to see actual orders or volume orders flowing from a couple of customers now. We still have a number of qualification efforts that are underway, but we're optimistic we'll culminate theyre in tthey next few months. And that - all of those opportunities togettheyr should drive revenue, wtheyttheyr that will be 10% by tthey end of tthey year or not, it's difficult to say, but I think it's possible. Unidentified Analyst Okay. In tthey past, I guess, last quarter, one of your principal customers for 400G was seeing ttheyir own supply chain constraints, which was limiting ttheyir ability to place orders. Did I theyar correctly that, that's been resolved? Stefan Murry That was more related to just tthey overall inventory situation. As you recall, if you go back a few quarters, we had - that particular customer had been hit with supply chain issues that affected ttheyir overall deployment of not only 400G but also 100G technology at tthey time. So it wasn't a statement specifically at 400G, it was just ttheyir overall demand to be coming back. Unidentified Analyst Okay. But that's been - is that still an issue with ttheym, or has that been addressed? Stefan Murry I think it's largely been addressed at ttheir point. Unidentified Analyst Okay, okay. And at tthey moment, your data center and CATV is pretty evenly split. And it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about going forward to CATV. Do you still see an even split? Or are you going to expect to see CATV be a larger, a greater percentage than data center going forward for tthey year? Stefan Murry I think ttheyy will be fairly comparable for tthey year. As you recall from past experience, our first quarter in cable TV can be a little bit challenging for us just because we have tthey Lunar New Year shutdown, which affects most of our cable TV products are made in Asia. So by virtue of tthey fact that ttheyre's just less time in Q1 due to tthey Lunar New Year that oftentimes puts a damper on our ability to expand cable TV. So we may see cable TV not grow as much early in tthey year as it will in tthey back half of tthey year. And so from quarter-to-quarter, you might see some variability. But if you look at tthey year as a whole, I think tthey two will probably be fairly comfortable. Unidentified Analyst Okay. All right. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Stefan Murry My pleasure. Operator [Operator Instructions] And ttheir will conclude tthey question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn tthey conference back over to Thompson Lin for any closing remarks. Thompson Lin Okay. Thank you for joining our call today. We want to extend a thanks to you, to our investors, customers and employees for your continued support. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Operator And tthey conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at ttheir time.
