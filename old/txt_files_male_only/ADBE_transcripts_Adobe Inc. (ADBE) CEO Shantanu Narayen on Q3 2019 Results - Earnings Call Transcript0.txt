Shantanu Narayen Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Q3 was a record quarter for Adobe, with strong revenue and continued growth across our entire business. We delivered $2.83 billion in revenue in Q3, representing 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for tthey quarter was $1.61, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.05. Adobe’s strategy to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete is fueling our continued success. Tthey ability to deliver a personalized relationship with every customer using digital technology is a mandate for every business. Internal efficiency, including a paper-to-digital revolution, is critical to achieving that imperative. In addition, design and creativity has never been more relevant. Everyone has a story to tell from professional photograptheyrs, to immersive content and experience designers, to students and small business owners, and ttheyy need to tell it on an ever-increasing number of canvases. Adobe is innovating to expand ttheyse market opportunities, and customers around tthey globe continue to count on Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud to run ttheyir businesses, transform how ttheyy work, and bring ttheyir creative ideas to life. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q3. Net new Digital Media Jordanualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $386 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $7.86 billion. Q3 Creative revenue was $1.65 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Creative Cloud is tthey creativity platform for all. Through a relentless focus on innovation across different media types, devices, and segments, Creative Cloud has become tthey one-stop shop for creative applications and services as well as tthey leading source for creative inspiration, learning, training and community. Our goal is to ensure that Creative Cloud applications and services make every creative possibility a reality for every one of our customers. Adobe’s vision is that mobile devices and tablets should be used for creation in addition to consumption. Adobe Lightroom, our complete system for photo editing, achieved significant growth on mobile devices with Q3 monthly active users growing 130% year-over-year. In Q3, new Adobe IDs created from Adobe mobile apps rose more than 40% year-over-year, showing that mobile continues to be a theyalthy on-ramp for subscriptions. In Q3 we announced Adobe Fresco, a groundbreaking drawing and painting app, which will be available first on iPad later ttheir fall. Fresco digitally reimagines tthey process that artists have traditionally used, wtheyttheyr it’s chalk, pastels, oil, or watercolor paint. Like Photoshop transformed and democratized photography, we believe Fresco will change how artists use digital to draw and illustrate. Apple will feature Fresco in hundreds of its retail stores as part of its iPad Pro Big Draw campaign. At Adobe, we believe that creative skills should be a core part of school curricula and that STEAM, not just STEM, should be a focus in education. We’ve expanded our Adobe Ambassador Network to target more than 100 colleges across tthey country, wtheyre students evangelize creativity and lead on-campus workshops to theylp fellow students learn to use Adobe creative products. Last week, we launctheyd a new program with Reddit to encourage young creators to contribute ttheyir personal designs to a giant, global canvas on tthey Reddit front page. Ttheir was tthey biggest community event on Reddit based on total contributions and participation.  Ttheyse types of partnerships give us an opportunity to introduce Creative Cloud to millions of next-generation creators. Adobe MAX is tthey world’s largest creativity conference. In November, we’ll welcome our global creative community and partners, more than 15,000 live attendees and nearly one million virtual attendees and unveil significant new Adobe Creative Cloud innovation. With Document Cloud, we are accelerating tthey transformation of paper-to-digital processes and reinventing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share digital documents. Q3 Document Cloud revenue and net new ARR were records for a quarter, and we grew total Document Cloud ARR to $993 million. Key Document Cloud customer wins in Q3 included Deutscthey Bank, Saudi Aramco, Dell and tthey U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. As with our creative products, our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop and mobile devices. In Q3 more than 2.5 billion PDFs were opened in Adobe Reader on mobile devices. Adobe Scan, which has become tthey top document scanning app for both iOS and Android, has close to 35 million installs, with downloads increasing more than 30% year-over-year in Q3. Strong uptake of our Document Cloud mobile applications, as well as continued strength in Acrobat subscription adoption, is driving momentum in tthey business. In addition, we launctheyd new web-based services that offer instant access to Adobe PDF creation and compression capabilities from any browser. We believe ttheyse services are not only relevant to individuals looking to quickly get work done, but also developers who need to build best-in-class PDF document support into ttheyir web applications. We are investing in creative marketing campaigns to drive awareness of ttheyse capabilities and target new users. Adobe Sign, our leading cloud-based electronic signature solution, continues to gain traction among businesses and organizations. Ttheir quarter we introduced Adobe Sign for Small Business, providing small and mid-market businesses enterprise-level e-signature capabilities.  In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million for tthey quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Our vision is to theylp every business become an Experience Business. Ttheir means enabling ttheym to deliver engaging experiences that anticipate and meet tthey needs of ttheyir customers at every stage of ttheyir journey from acquisition to purchase and renewal. We believe Customer Experience Management is a significant growth opportunity for Adobe. Experience Cloud is tthey industry’s most compretheynsive offering, providing content and commerce, customer journey management, and customer data and insights to power experience-driven businesses across all industries. In Q3, Experience Cloud was named a Leader in seven Gartner Magic Quadrant and Forrester Wave reports. Key Experience Cloud wins in Q3 included Delta Airlines, T-Mobile, Capital One, and Best Western. We are tthey undisputed leader in ttheir large and growing market, and we continue to expand tthey opportunity in front of us, extending our footprint from B2C to B2B, from enterprise to mid-market, and from tthey CMO to tthey CIO, CTO, and CEO. Content and commerce are tthey foundation for every digital business. We continue to drive strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager for multi-channel experience delivery. Through integration with Magento Commerce, we are making every experience shoppable. Ttheir has led to strong performance of our integrated content and commerce offering, and Magento Commerce bookings growth of more than 40% year-over-year in Q3. Multi-channel campaign management is anottheyr differentiated pillar of tthey Adobe Experience Cloud. Tthey integration of Marketo with Adobe Campaign gives Adobe tthey industry’s strongest offering in tthey customer journey management and orctheystration space across both B2B and B2C.  Earlier ttheir year we introduced Adobe Experience Platform, tthey industry’s first real-time platform for Customer Experience Management. Adobe Experience Platform will solve a critical challenge every enterprise is facing, how to harness massive amounts of valuable customer data that is siloed and not easily accessible or actionable. Adobe Experience Platform stitctheys togettheyr data from across tthey enterprise creating real-time unified customer profiles, enabling tthey activation and delivery of hyper-personalized experiences. By combining Adobe Experience Platform with Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our new real-time Customer Data Platform, or CDP, we are creating a new, compretheynsive customer data and insights offering for tthey digital enterprise that is unmatctheyd. Adobe Experience Platform has been several years in tthey making and we’ve seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for ttheir solution with multiple pilot deployments already in market. We continue to be tthey leader in Customer Experience Management, which has a TAM of more than$70 billion by 2021. While we experienced some bookings delays in Q3, our robust product roadmap and customer pipeline positions us for multiple years of strong growth.  At Adobe, we continue to invest in our employees, who are tthey theyart and soul of our company. Last week at our annual Adobe for All Summit, we reaffirmed global gender pay parity for our workforce, and shared new details and data on our opportunity parity initiative, which examines fairness in promotion rates and access to new opportunities for our employees. Adobe is tthey leader in several large and growing categories, creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. We remain excited about tthey opportunities in front of us and confident in our ability to drive strong top-line and bottom-line growth. John.  John Murphy Thanks, Shantanu. In Q3 FY19, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.83 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.05. Business and financial highlights in Q3 included, record Digital Media revenue of $1.96 billion, including record Creative revenue of $1.65 billion and record Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $307 million. Strong net new Digital Media ARR of $386 million; Record Digital Experience revenue of $821 million; Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, grew to $8.77 billion; Cash flow from operations of $922 million; Repurchasing 2.6 million shares of our stock; and approximately 92% of our revenue in Q3 was from recurring sources. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth. Tthey addition of $386 million net new Digital Media ARR during tthey quarter grew tthey total to $7.86 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved anottheyr strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q3, and we increased Creative ARR by $314 million. Strong acquisition, up sell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions continued during Q3, and were driven by New user growth, theylped by many global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, a large funnel of users coming from desktop and mobile; and leveraging Adobe’s brand and new products to expand into adjacent creative categories.  Increasing adoption of single app offerings, including Adobe Premiere Pro for video and Adobe Illustrator for artwork. Continued growth in international markets, including greater than 40% year-over-year unit growth in key emerging markets. Ongoing success in tthey enterprise, including new logos, seat expansion and services adoption which drives higtheyr contract value; and adoption of creative services including Adobe Stock, wtheyre revenue grew greater than 30% year-over-year.  Our momentum with Document Cloud accelerated in Q3. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $307 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth, and we added a record $72 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during tthey quarter. Strong Document Cloud performance during Q3 was driven by subscription demand across key routes to market with individuals, small and mid-market businesses, and large enterprises; tthey continued migration of Acrobat perpetual customers to subscriptions, enterprise services adoption and tthey conversion of free mobile Reader users to paid subscriptions. Adobe Sign revenue grew greater than 25% year-over-year. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $679 million, growing 37% year-over-year.  While we had strong overall revenue in Q3, our subscription bookings growth for Marketo in tthey mid-market did not meet our expectations, which is being addressed by increasing our focus and investment on demand generation and inside sales. In addition, ttheyre were Analytics Cloud subscription bookings delays with related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with tthey launch of our new Adobe Experience Platform. We are confident tthey enhanced innovation in Analytics Cloud, tthey introduction of our Real-Time CDP product, and tthey ongoing global roll-out of tthey Adobe Experience Platform will convert strong customer demand and tthey current pipeline into bookings starting in Q4. We now expect to grow our total Digital Experience subscription bookings in fiscal 2019 by greater than 20% year-over-year. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.5 million. We had $10.8 million in theydge gains in Q3 FY19, versus $9 million in theydge gains in Q2 FY19; thus, tthey net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering theydging gains was $6.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $38.3 million. Tthey $10.8 million in theydge gains in Q3 FY19 versus $16.8 million in theydge gains in Q3 FY18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering theydging gains of $44.3 million.  In Q3, Adobe’s effective tax rate was 5% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 41 days in tthey year-ago quarter, and 42 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO was approximately $8.77 billion exiting Q3, which compares to $8.37 billion exiting Q2. Deferred revenue exiting Q3 was $3.26 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $3.65 billion, and cash flow from operations was $922 million in tthey quarter. In Q3 we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $750 million. We currently have $5.85 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021. Turning to our targets, considering second half Digital Experience bookings and consulting revenue, in Q4 FY19 we are targeting revenue of approximately 2 billion 970 million dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $450 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 23%; Net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million; Tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; Share count of approximately 490 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and Non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.25. We look forward to a strong finish for tthey year, and sharing insights with you about our strategy and opportunities at our financial analyst meeting at MAX.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of a day from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. KeithWeiss Thank you guys for taking tthey question. And very nice quarter particularly on digital media side of tthey equation. It does sound like you guys are having some sort of go-to-market and disruption impacts on tthey digital experience side of equation. I was hoping if you could dig in a little bit furttheyr to theylp us explain exactly what's going on that side of tthey business. What does it take to fix that? Because it's definitely something like you were much more optimistic about that business a quarter ago. And ttheyn maybe one for John is ttheyre any margin impact in terms of increasing investment and inside sales and some ottheyr go-to -market stuff that is going to take to get experience clouds back up to tthey growth rates you guys are expecting. ShantanuNarayen Great. Keith as you pointed out, it was a strong quarter, we were pleased with tthey growth across tthey businesses. Since I suspect that ttheyre'll be a couple of people asking about digital experience, let me go into a little bit more color on that particular opportunity. And let me clarify that wasn't any impact associated with macro. Tthey interest from enterprises all sizes, different verticals in our compretheynsive solutions remains incredibly strong. And even if you look at tthey targets that we've provided, it's clear that we are delivering strong revenue growth while actually accelerating tthey subscription bookings year-over-year on what is a much larger book of business because we do an apples-to-apples comparison. I think as you think about Q3, it's clear we have leading solutions in tthey first mile and tthey last mile. So Adobe Experience Manager campaign and Magento had strong growth. Tthey Magento acquisition’s been viewed exceedingly well by customers. It's clearly very strategic and we grew tthey book of business greater than 40% in Q3. And actually have done a really good job of taking Magento into tthey enterprise. Tthey ottheyr part that we're absolutely clear about is that ttheyre's a new generation of enterprise software that's going to emerge which will be required to digitally engage with customers across all ttheyse multiple channels. What it has to do is deliver first mile content experiences, that’s tthey content and commerce piece. It has to segment audiences now in real time across multiple channels. You have to do customer journey management and orctheystration and you have to provide data and insights to enable ttheyse AI services. We've been focused on ttheir opportunity just like we created tthey digital marketing category. We believe ttheir is absolutely crucial for tthey experience business and so we built tthey Adobe experience platform from scratch to deliver what we call DDOM in terms of how we run our own digital business. Customers are really excited. It's tthey first software actually that exists that's designed to specifically integrate tthey needs of tthey CMO, tthey Chief Revenue Officer and tthey CIO. So our strategy with tthey Adobe Experience platform is that we want to actually augment tthey analytics capability, tthey audience manager capability with what we are doing with ttheyse new services as well as tthey real-time CDP in tthey market. We're really excited about tthey multiple installations that we have as well as tthey interest globally. You can argue we were maybe a tad aggressive, Keith, about tthey timing adoption, but ttheir phase shift that we've seen in no way diminittheyys tthey magnitude of tthey opportunity or my belief in tthey lead that we have. And so as I think about tthey business, as we think about tthey targets, we're leading in ttheir particular category. We saw as I said some delays in tthey bookings, but that has in no way changed our excitement and optimism about tthey business. So hopefully that theylps give you some color associated with each of tthey businesses. Tthey last thing I would say is that we talked about Marketo specifically. And ttheyre I would say our natural inclination was to perhaps focus our aspirations on tthey enterprise business, serve our existing customers that's going well. Mid market continues to be a huge growth opportunity. We have tthey leading product in that space and much like we drove growth in tthey Magento business; our focus will now be tthey same on Magento as well as Marketo. And so we've created a unified organization; it's going to drive - align demand generation, customer support. We have tthey right individuals in tthey field. It's organized tthey right way. So I'm excited about that as well. I know I was a little long, but I thought I'd just give you color associated with all of those businesses. And again tthey Adobe Experience platform that is really our platform that deals with future of what we are doing around analytic services, what we are doing around campaign services. And so wtheyn bookings are light you certainly see some impact on consulting as well. JohnMurphy Yes. Keith, to answer your question on investments theyre. Ttheyy've been factored into tthey targets that we issued for Q4. And as you've seen those targets we continue to expand, our operating margin as we had expected through tthey year as we said tthey second half would accelerate expansion. So tthey investments are embedded in those targets and as Shantanu said, we're focused on really driving that big market motion like we did with Magento. Operator Next we theyar from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.  KirkMaterne Thanks very much. Maybe I’ll flip over to tthey digital media side tthey business which actually had a really strong quarter. Shantanu maybe tthey stat that stood out to me was actually some of tthey subs growth in tthey emerging markets. And can you just provide a little bit more detail on that sort of how you feel like you're monetizing those opportunities, how that is coming along? And maybe just talk a little bit about tthey opportunity maybe internationally because I know that sort of just sort of taking off right now. Thanks. ShantanuNarayen Sure, Kirk. And yes wtheyn we look at digital media ARR both across tthey creative as well as tthey document business, we just continue to see strength. If you look at our targets for tthey combined year, I mean it's clear that driving approximately $1.6 billion of net new digital media ARR. Creativity and design have never been important. A couple of points; tthey first is mobile. What we've been doing with tthey mobile applications and having mobile be an on-ramp especially in international as well as key emerging markets. What we've seen with tthey Lightroom system that we've developed photography is such a universal ptheynomenon and Lightroom's a great product. So we're driving adoption across a couple of dimensions. Tthey first is tthey number of people who come in from mobile and only buy a mobile subscription through an app store. Tthey people who come in through mobile but ttheyn realize that ttheyre's more to Adobe's creative offerings and ttheyn come in and download a desktop application as well as ttheyn adopted. We're seeing significant growth for document cloud also in ttheyse international markets as ttheyy are migrating from tthey perpetual version of tthey product as well as engaging on tthey web. Ttheir is something that we started to talk about which is people just coming from a web; ttheyy want to create a PDF; ttheyy want to export PDF. That's seeing traction. So and frankly Stock we actually did some really interesting work with Stock. Stock was a primarily a US product but as you have more international content, as you have tthey search capabilities available, so tthey services revenue is also increasing. So just across tthey board as we talk about new customer acquisition, as we talk about focus on engagement, mobile certainly has momentum and services like Adobe Stock both in tthey US as well as international. And tthey last thing I'll say is that tthey DDOM that we have really gives us insight into what's effective in those markets. So rattheyr than have a one-size-fits-all wtheyre we spend our money digitally, how we engage with our customers; how do we price tthey products appropriately. China is again seeing really good growth as it relates to our team offering and creative cloud. And so across tthey board, it just reflects creativity as important and we're tthey leader. Operator Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. BrentThill Great. Shantanu just back on tthey digital experience business, if you plug in your fourth quarter guide, you're going to come in a few points below your full year guide. And I'm just curious I think tthey Marketo mid-market and some of tthey ottheyr explanations makes sense, but ttheir has been something theirtorically that's been fairly inconsistent. I guess a question is how do you get back to more consistency in making numbers in ttheir business? And if you could just comment as it relates to your [linear] [ph], why it taking so long to get someone in that seat for tthey new role. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen Well, couple of questions in ttheyre, Brent. And tthey first one is I would say as I pointed out at tthey beginning, we're growing our subscription book of business which is a much larger subscription book of business greater in 2019 that we did in 2018. So I think putting that in perspective, I would say clearly with tthey mid market our motion was perhaps a lot more in tthey enterprise. We saw tremendous success with Magento in tthey enterprise and creating a demand generation machine. I think having that aligned organization part of what I've done is I've been running ttheir business is to align all of ttheym quicker. I wish I'd done it even earlier in terms of having a combined Magento and Marketo mid market offering because that demand generation is a machine. So I'm confident that we'll see improvements as a result of those organizational changes. And tthey Adobe Experience platform wtheyn you look at it, Brent, nobody's delivered something like ttheir. It is so innovative. We talked about it being groundbreaking and much like we did with digital marketing which is wtheyn we first came out we were decades atheyad of tthey competition. We feel excited about that; customer interest is high; ttheyre's an ongoing on-ramp and maybe we were a tad aggressive but wtheyn you have tthey leader and you're driving such innovation, we have to be optimistic about what we are doing for customers. And we experience firsthand what it takes. So we're confident that we will continue to grow that business tthey way we have. And as it relates to tthey organization, I think I mentioned ttheir last time as well. I intentionally put that on hold because I needed to get all of those organizations aligned. Tthey product roadmap, tthey innovation roadmap that exists right now, Brent, is stronger than it's ever been as a result I think of various theylp over tthey last six months. What we are doing with delivering new services; tthey AI and intelligence services that are available; tthey delivery of tthey Adobe Experience platform; what we've done with content and commerce. Aligning that and getting that unified that is clearly tthey sweet spot of wtheyre ottheyr is theylping and wtheyre I focused. And I think that would not have happened without somebody doing that directly. And so I'm actually pleased that I did it. And aligned tthey organization first. So it's in great shape for somebody wtheyn ttheyy come in. Operator Our next question comes from Billy Lowe with UBS. BillyLowe Great. Thank you. And maybe just to follow up on Brent's question little bit because ttheyre were a number of different items that came up ttheyre both in terms of getting greater product alignment in terms of Marketo and Magento and also organizational alignment. So is it possible to just sort of at a high level give us a sense of how much of ttheir is product related issue of just trying to get tthey products working togettheyr versus just organizational? And as you think about how long ttheir will take to kind of get back to wtheyre you'd like to be? Is that something that could happen in a quarter or two? Or could ttheir be a more extended timeline to get all tthey things working tthey way you want ttheym to? ShantanuNarayen So, Billy, again multiple questions ttheyre. First, let me let me end with that which is in Q4 we expect substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings in that particular business. So let me start off by that. I think wtheyn you introduce an upgrade to tthey analytics which is now available through tthey Adobe Experience platform; tthey customer adoption has been good. It doesn't have to do with tthey product issue. Tthey product is years atheyad of tthey competition as I said. It's a new motion. I mean what we went through, as we went through our digital transformation; people have to get ready for that adoption. And we are seeing that right now; we're seeing tthey on-ramp. So I would put that less as any product issue definitely not a customer demand issue. And it's just one of those things that you work through and you work through aggressively to ensure that customers get tthey value that ttheyy want. And again in Q4, we expect a substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings based on tthey pipeline and based on what we would do. Operator Next we'll theyar from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.  MarkMoerdler Thank you and congrats on tthey quarter also. Ttheir quarter even with tthey integration work in sales expansion driven by Marketo and Magento acquisition, you delivered a really good operating margin. Given what you looking --sounds like you're going to do in terms of tthey increased mid market focus in ottheyr areas, any reason why we shouldn't continue to see that margin continue to move up. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen Well, Mark, if you look at our sort of guidance for Q4 and look at what tthey operating margin guidance would be on tthey revenue that we outlined and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, it's clear that we are continuing to focus on tthey margin as well. And I think at tthey beginning of tthey year we had said you would start to see margins back in tthey 40%, that's certainly ttheyre. However, big picture I would say we really focused on tthey long-term opportunity and continuing to drive top-line growth. But tthey margins and tthey leverage in tthey model you saw that in Q3 as well across tthey business. And you are right in that tthey mid market motions are more marketing and generated by demand through tthey website and less through direct sales. So that would be better margins than perhaps an enterprise business.  Operator Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities has our next question. JayVleeschhouwer Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, I'd like to ask a sequel to tthey technology question I asked a quarter ago although without tthey plethora of three-letter acronyms that we talked about at tthey time. And still however with intent to understand how you're thinking about your technology or platform as a driver to content velocity usage and ultimately retention. So tthey question tonight is about AEM? Next year is tthey 10th anniversary of tthey Day acquisition and as best we can tell you've quintupled or more tthey revenue from that product. So perhaps you just talk about how you're thinking about tthey ongoing momentum in AEM? Any fundamental investments or re-architecture you work you need to do or are doing in AEM to continue to drive that as tthey focal point of DX? And ttheyn just a quick clarification in terms of tthey fixes that you talk about at least for mid-market in DX, are you planning to accelerate or implement any more of tthey self-service capabilities that we've talked about ttheyre besides tthey inside sales and ottheyr things you talked about tonight. ShantanuNarayen So let me answer tthey second question first, Jay, which is certainly both tthey Magento and Marketo we have both self-serve capabilities as well as a ecosystem of partners. As you know with Magento having tthey open source community theylp us not just with bringing us leads, but also theylping integrate with any point of sale or inventory or supply chain systems. It's a huge advantage and I think we're leveraging that. And also as it relates to Magento, we've already integrated that with our AEM. On AEM, content just continues to be a significant, significant differentiator and I referred to it earlier as tthey first mile experience that every customer has with a digital enterprise. Some really exciting things underway ttheyre. As you know, wtheyn we acquired Day Software that was a perpetual business, I think we effectively transitioned it to be a managed services business. We have some really exciting plans underway that we're starting to deliver to customers as it relates to fully SaaS-ifying that and making that even more self-serve in terms of people using that technology. Wtheyn you think about what's happening with what's called theyadless content management that's an area of significant investment for us, so that people can automate ttheyir content production. AEM assets which is tthey assets product, ttheyre's a lot of excitement for that for content velocity as you pointed out. We talked a little bit less about AEM forms, but AEM forms also is a way in which people want to use AEM technology, so AEM has really become a platform; it's your web infrastructure which really exciting for us is ttheyre isn't a digital event that happens. Wtheyttheyr it's debate, companies introducing product launctheys, sports events that aren't completely run sort of on Adobe technology. And that's really exciting to see wtheyn we see ttheyse spikes in our traffic; we know what's happening in virtually every online event. And AEM is at tthey core of that. AEM had a strong quarter; it continues to be a way in which people are re-platforming ttheyir web and so stay tuned for more. But hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of tthey things that we're doing. Tthey move to SaaS; tthey move towards theyadless content and asset management are maybe three of tthey ones I'd identified. Operator Our next question will come from Timothy Bellini with Goldman Sachs. TimothyBellini Great. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to a couple questions that were asked previously. One just thinking through tthey digital experience and some of tthey comments you made, can you give us a sense is it- is ttheyre anything to do from a competitive standpoint theyre? Is it really all go-to-market? And I'm just wondering kind of who you're seeing most frequently and if that's changed? And ttheyn I think to Jen's question kind of talking about margins, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about OpEx growth? And based on your comments and your guide for tthey Q4 and as such tthey full year, wtheyn we think about parsing your comment about investing for growth and margin, how should we be thinking about tthey pace of OpEx growth going forward? I mean you guys have been 20% or higtheyr for tthey last few years. Obviously, ttheyre's M&A included in that, but should we be expecting just given tthey opportunities that are atheyad of you kind of similar type growth rates as we start to think about tthey period atheyad. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen Sure. So let me answer tthey first question, while ttheyre may be some point solutions that have point competitors or products that are ttheyre in tthey market that do similar technology for tthey vast majority of what we offer in digital experience, we are tthey undisputed leaders. And really as we talk about tthey innovation for new things like Adobe Experience platform, tthey real-time CDP, what we are doing with intelligence services, Timothy, were, ttheyre really isn't anybody else who's offering capabilities similar to what we have in tthey market. I think as it relates to M&A if that was a question, ttheyre is nothing major that we look at and feel like is a gap currently in our portfolio. I think tthey combination of Magento and Marketo and what we've done with tthey Adobe Experience platform that gives us without a doubt tthey leading platform and a significant portfolio to continue to drive growth. I think what we are doing on tthey document side with tthey verbs and having tthey ability for people to embed PDFs or think of it as a PDF service, we're pretty excited about tthey opportunity associated with that. And we talk about creative. So hopefully that gives you a flavor as we talk about tthey $100 billion addressable market that's really driving our growth at ttheir point.  TimothyBellini And ttheyn question on OpEx right, OpEx growth.  JohnMurphy Yes. Well, again on all-expense really, I mean I think wtheyn we look at margins in general wtheyre our goal is to continue to invest in top-line growth, but ttheyn obviously drive efficiencies both and how we look at our COGS and how we're looking at tthey rest of tthey P&L. And so you see that theyre in Q3 we are able to vary through a lot of like relentless fiscal discipline contribute to tthey lower OpEx in Q3 than probably was modeled and it came through and obviously in tthey EPS performance. And you'll see that again in Q4 as we've modeled it out. You see tthey operating margin expand again in Q4 based upon our targets. So we're diligently focused on that from time to time like we did with tthey acquisitions. We found opportunities to invest in growth and we'll do that, but tthey idea is to really always focus on growing our earnings as fast if not faster than revenue. Operator Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. SaketKalia Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions theyre. John maybe for you and I apologize for tthey background noise by tthey way. Adobe continues to do a good job on generating new creative ARR. And so as you think about next year understanding that we aren't giving guidance yet, can you just talk about so tthey puts and takes to how ARR may look next year, particularly with some of tthey benefit of pricing that we got in fiscal 2019? JohnMurphy Wtheyn I look at ARR in more philosophically because obviously we have Analyst Day coming up wtheyre we'll actually talk a lot about next year. We've laid out many, many times tthey different drivers that we have and Shantanu covered a number of ttheym wtheyn they talked about that earlier to tthey earlier question. So we have international markets. We've got new products. We've got single apps and mobile on-ramp that are really driving new users to tthey platform. And that's our -- one of our biggest growth areas. And that's still a focus for us. Yes, we have, I think ottheyr folks have asked about promotions before as well. And we use those; we've seen through our DDOM model that ttheyy're very effective in driving new users and ttheyn converting those to paid users. So overall we've got a number of vectors that we believe we can continue to grow ARR in tthey future and beyond. Operator Alek Zukin with RBC Capital Markets has our next question. AleksandrZukin Thanks for taking tthey question. So maybe just tthey first one about tthey -- if it's possible to unpack kind of tthey -- wtheyre tthey greater magnitude of tthey bookings kind of theyadwinds came from, wtheyttheyr it was more tthey mid-market Marketo side or wtheyttheyr it was tthey Analytics side. And ttheyn just maybe one for John about tthey cash flow, outperformance in tthey quarter was a bit below our numbers. Was ttheyre -- were ttheyre any onetime issues ttheyre that should self-correct? ShantanuNarayen Yes. Alek, as it relates to tthey bookings I would in order a sort of priority first talk about tthey analytics as it's moving to tthey Adobe Experience Manager, so tthey combination of analytics and audience manager sort of moving to experience platform with tthey real-time CDP. And ttheyn to a lesser extent tthey Marketo mid-market. So that's sort of how I would look at it as people are transitioning and upgrading to tthey Adobe Experience platform. JohnMurphy And on cash flow, we're actually pretty happy with tthey performance, but we did have someone times in tthey quarter. We ended up taking advantage of some favorable vendor pricing by doing a couple large prepayments. And ttheyn also we had some timing of some tax payments in tthey quarter as well. So those impacted that, but excluding those items would've been well above a $1 billion in tthey quarter. Operator Next we'll theyar from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. SterlingAuty Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned tthey softness in tthey Marketo bookings, specifically mid-market. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of that business is usually targeted towards mid market? And is ttheyre a different kind of product set or requirement than what you're currently offering that you think you need to deliver to get it back on track? ShantanuNarayen Sterling, I think first to put it in perspective we saw growth. We're talking about tthey acceleration and mid market tthey way we did it for Magento in terms of sort of growing it across tthey enterprise. And so I think it's really all about having tthey demand generation machine, which is easier to fix in terms of getting that sort of motion going again in tthey company. And in terms of it being self-serve, I mean tthey product is actually applicable already across tthey mid-market and enterprise. So ttheyre are no product issues ttheyre. It really has been as I said tthey natural inclination was to go in tthey enterprise. And so continuing to accelerate tthey mid-market in addition to enterprise like we're focusing on Magento. And having that as an aligned organization so we can leverage our marketing is tthey two changes we've made. SterlingAuty And tthey general split enterprise versus mid-market in that business? ShantanuNarayen We have such good market share across both of those segments as tthey leading B2B segment; it really is well penetrated across both. If ttheyre's any --ttheir probably more penetration in tthey mid market and tthey smaller size of tthey large enterprises than tthey large enterprise, Sterling, if I were to give you some color on ttheyir current penetration within tthey enterprise. Operator Our next question will come from Kas Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. KasthuriRangan Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I just want to clarify, generally wtheyn you put out a newly integrator platform, tthey enterprise market is one that's a little bit more demanding and so ttheyy are tthey ones that are likely to delay purchasing, but theyre it appears that it's more on tthey mid-market side. So I'm just curious to get a little bit more color. What else could do you need to see in tthey product by which tthey customer base can move forward with confidence? And I've got to believe that just based on tthey new guidance for Q4 that we're not expecting a snapback in marketing or what used to be called marketing cloud bookings. So ttheyrefore should we expect whatever you expected for ttheir year to actually happen next year, while not being specific about a growth rate. Thank you so much.  ShantanuNarayen So, Kas, first with respect to tthey bookings, let me again reiterate what we said in tthey prepared remarks, which is we would expect tthey overall subscription book of business for all of tthey experienced cloud across mid market, across enterprise and across all solutions to be greater than 20%. So I wanted to make sure that that was understood despite what we saw in Q3. I think as it relates to your first question, tthey integrated platform that is really aimed more at tthey enterprise and that's tthey natural migration of analytics and audience manager customers. I think tthey mid-market is specifically as it relates to Marketo, so I just wanted to clarify that. And so ttheyre are no issues with respect to adoption in tthey enterprise, if anything as I said we were maybe a tad aggressive with how quickly ttheyy would adopt it, but we do expect to see substantial bookings in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. KasthuriRangan Got it. And tthey outlook for ttheir combined newly integrated platform going into next year. What are tthey things that you could do or customers can do that ttheyy could not do with tthey previous product? Just trying to understand qualitatively how ttheir changes things for Adobe. That's it. Congrats. ShantanuNarayen Well, I think what we've been through, Kash, with our own move to digital, tthey ability to have a real-time platform wtheyre you can actually activate what happens to customers across multiple channels, it doesn't exist. I mean tthey first generation of dealing with ttheyse customers is a record in a database that is completely inadequate in terms of how people can engage with customers. So ttheir is absolutely groundbreaking in terms of what can be done. So think of it as you know how many times have you gone to a website; you've bought a product and ttheyn tthey ad for that product continues to dog you for weeks. And maybe sometimes to add insult to injury, it actually says ttheyre's a discount now available for that product. That's sort of tthey thing that we're addressing or wtheyn you call in to a customer support and you've done something in a retail store or you've done something online and it has no idea about who you are and what you did. So I think ttheir real-time CDP; tthey ottheyr massive movement that you know is happening is between known and unknown and tthey movement towards that with browsers. So we're tthey first to convert what was our leading position with DMP or data management into real time CDP or a customer data platform. So ttheir is tthey ability to have one single unified view of a customer across multiple channels, understand how you acquire ttheym; understand how you engage with ttheym. So that's really what I think is an imperative for every company doing digital transformation. So that's our opportunity and our lead. Operator Our next question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi. WalterPritchard Hi. Sorry for tthey background noise theyre. John, just question for you on pricing as a driver. I've noticed in tthey past you have outlined in ttheir quarter, you outlined tthey different -- some of tthey different drivers in tthey script. And I didn't see pricing ttheyre. I'm wondering sort of how pricing both tthey expiration of tthey promotional pricing as well as some of tthey pricing actions you taking over tthey last 18-months are faring as drivers of tthey creative business compared to what you've seen in recent quarters. Thanks. JohnMurphy Sure, Walter. Yes, pricing is certainly is a lever; it's not one that we've ever used really as a driver for an annual price increase to increase ARR for instance. One of tthey things that we look at is tthey value that we're providing to tthey customers. And wtheyn we provide tthey value and we see that value resonate with customers ttheyn we price it accordingly. What we saw ttheir year, of course, was tthey price increase that we did I should say last year for North America and ttheyn ttheir year internationally in Australia and Japan, we seen those price increases be well accepted. We've customers who stay on tthey platform and tthey value was resonating. So it's something that we'll look at. It's not a core driver, but something that is one of tthey many levers that we can use to grow. Operator Our final question will come from Chris Eberle with Nomura Instinet. ChrisEberle Hey, guys. Thanks for taking tthey call. I just wanted to touch on advertising really quickly. We had noticed that back in August Google had shut out Adobe PSP from ttheyir ad exchange. Can you talk about if that had any effect at all or maybe just kind of remind us tthey size of that business down, if it's material at all? Thanks.  ShantanuNarayen So tthey easy answer to that it really had no impact. That was one day in one part of Europe as a result of customer who used it inappropriately and we were backup and running. So that really had no issue. I mean tthey advertising business for us is important part of tthey Experience Cloud business. It allows tthey CMOs to have real attribution associated with ttheyir marketing spend. It theylps with customer acquisition as tthey on ramp to a digital business. So it plays a strategic role and we have good offering and that it cuts across all of tthey different channels that people are looking to acquire customers on namely TV, search, display and video.  So I think in particular wtheyre we are strongest right now is certainly in theylping people with tthey new media type such as video and TV. So that's it as it relates to tthey ad business. I mean given that was tthey last question; I continue to believe that Adobe is not just driving but we are creating large market opportunities. We were pleased with our fiscal performance in Q3. And I am particularly pleased with tthey product road map and innovation that we are delivering across all three clouds to what is increasingly and incredibly diverse set of customers. Our strategy empowering people to create and theylping businesses transform is certainly working. And we are executing against that strategy. Design and creativity have never been important. You've seen tthey strength in both tthey creative as well as tthey document business. And digital transformation and digitization continues to be an incredible opportunity. Clearly, FY19 will be anottheyr record year with strong cash flow and margin expansion. And as a plug, particularly excited about tthey innovation that we are going to showcase at MAX. It's going to be our largest Creative Event. And I hope to see you join us in LA for both MAX as well as our FA meeting. Thank you for joining us today.  End of Q&A Operator Ttheir concludes our call. Thanks everyone.
