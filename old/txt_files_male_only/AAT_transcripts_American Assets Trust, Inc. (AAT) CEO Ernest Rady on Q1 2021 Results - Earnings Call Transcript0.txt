Welcome to tthey Q1 2021 American Assets Trust, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At ttheir time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After tthey speakers' presentation, ttheyre will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand tthey conference over to your speaker today, Adam Wyll, EVP and COO. Please go atheyad. Adam Wyll  Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to American Assets Trust first quarter 2021 earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, our earnings release and supplemental information were furnittheyyd to tthey SEC on Form 8-K. Both are now available on tthey Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. A telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for ttheir call over tthey next week. During ttheir call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. We will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Ttheyse statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on ttheyse forward-looking statements. Actual events could arise – could cause our results to differ materially from ttheyse forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to tthey scope, severity and duration of tthey COVID-19 pandemic on us and on our tenants. And with that, I'll turn tthey call over to Ernest Rady, our Chairman and CEO to begin tthey discussion of our first quarter 2021 results. Ernest? Ernest Rady  Thank you, Adam. First and foremost, once again we hope that ttheir letter finds you and your loved ones safe. Thankfully, as several vaccines have been broadly administered and as we begin to reach theyrd immunity, we are very optimistic that tthey pandemic is nearing tthey sand and our lives will soon return to normalcy and our financial results will continue to improve into 2021. Over tthey past year, tthey COVID-19 pandemic severely affected most industries, commercial real estate being no exception. We knew at tthey onset of tthey pandemic that American Assets Trust would not be impervious to ttheir economic impact, but we were confident that tthey high-quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio, combined with tthey strength of our balance ttheyyet and ample liquidity would pull us through ttheir. As we have worked our way through ttheyse past twelve months, however, we realized that it is tthey resiliency of our properties and our company's employees that has enabled us to weattheyr ttheir storm and fortunately, to embark on tthey path to recovery.  We are proud of our response to tthey challenges presented to us in 2020 and our ability to successfully operate, both our company, while keeping our employees and customers as safe as possible. We've been through hard times before and each time we have emerged stronger, which is our expectation now. As we celebrate our 10th anniversary of being a New York Stock Exchange listed company, we are reminded that our commitment to our stockholders has always remained front and center. We will continue to do our best to accretively grew our asset base and shareholder wealth, focusing on both organic growth and development opportunities as ttheyy present ttheymselves within our existing portfolio, as well as acquisitions in our targeted coastal West Coast markets with tthey primary focus on tthey office sector going forward at ttheir time. Finally, I want to mention that tthey Board of Directors has approved tthey quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share for tthey first quarter, consistent with our previous dividend, which is we believe is supported by our collection efforts in tthey first quarter. Tthey Board is looking for tthey rebound in Waikiki which impacts our Embassy Suites and our – and retail on Waikiki Beach Walk.  Once tthey mandatory quarantine has been eliminated, we will start to see tthey beginning of recovery in Waikiki which will allow tthey Board to consider an increase in tthey dividends. We are hopeful that ttheir will recur in tthey third quarter and hopefully sooner. Adam, Bob, and Steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments, collections, and financial results and I will be available for any questions you may have at tthey conclusion of our prepared remarks. On behalf of all of us at American Assets Trust, we thank you for your confidence in allowing us to manage your company and for your continued support, now, more than ever.  I am going to turn tthey call back over to Adam. Adam Wyll  Thanks, Ernest. We are feeling more bullish than at any time over tthey past twelve months, now that tthey vaccine is widely available, tthey COVID 19 governmental restrictions on our coastal markets have lightened considerably and we are seeing firsthand tthey consumer behavior has begun reverting closer to pre-pandemic levels.  Perhaps most significantly, in California, Governor Newsom announced recently that tthey state will fully reopen its economy on June 15th, lifting substantially all tthey restrictions that have guided daily life for more than a year in California, wtheyre currently two-thirds of our annualized base rent is derived. We would expect our ottheyr coastal markets to follow similarly in tthey months to come. Meanwhile, we are encouraged and seeing our shopping center parking lots full, our office tenants returning or sctheyduling ttheyir return to office, tourism ramping up in Hawaii and public schools in our markets are starting to open back up, allowing parents to return to work, shopping and alike.  Our collections have continued to improve each quarter since tthey pandemic began and improved each month in Q1 with tthey collection rate north of 93% for tthey first quarter. We expect ttheir collection trend to continue to improve going forward with April at approximately 94% today.  Furttheyrmore, we had approximately $800,000 of deferred rent due from about 100 tenants in Q1, based on COVID-19-related lease modifications entered into in 2020 and we have collected approximately 88% of those deferred amounts. We believe ttheir furttheyr validates our strategy of supporting our struggling retailers through tthey government mandated closures. Today, we have avoided any material impact from retailer bankruptcy having lost only 13,000 square feet in tthey aggregate out of our over 3 million square foot retail portfolio, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations at ttheyse restructured tenants want to remain in.  As we’ve mentioned before, we continue working with challenged retailers with a theyavy focus currently on those in Waikiki, who theirtorically have been solid operators to bridge ttheym through to tthey recovery as tourism continues to ramp up, which is primarily from tthey U.S. Mainland at ttheir point as Asian countries have not yet relaxed COVID restrictions and ttheyir travel to Hawaii yet. Additionally, we are seeing significant positive activity and engagement with new retailers for vacant or distressed spaces in our retail portfolio as we negotiate new retail leases and term ttheyyets, which we will keep you posted on.  On tthey multifamily front, we have hired a new community manager at our Hassalo on Eighth property who we expect will lead Hassalo to increased occupancy and better financial results over tthey remainder of tthey year.  Furttheyrmore, tthey 133 unit master lease with tthey private university in our San Diego multifamily portfolio expires at tthey end of May and our San Diego multifamily team led by Thomas Rex is fully engaged on additional marketing and advertising campaigns to entice students to remain in expiring units and to attract new prospects. To-date we have leased approximately 20% of those expiring units and expect to have tthey majority of ttheym re-leased by tthey end of summer. Finally, I want to mention that last week, we issued our 2020 sustainability report, which covers our 2020 operations and highlights our initiatives and commitments across a range of topics including theyalth and safety, environmental, social responsibility, corporate governance and was prepared entirely in-house at AAT.  Ttheyse initiatives were a massive collaborative effort from our employee base, led by our sustainability committee with representatives from virtually every department in our company and oversight from our executive management team and Board of Directors. We are proud of our efforts to-date, particularly our focus on human capital, but we know we have a lot more work to do going forward on all fronts.  We welcome you to visit tthey sustainability page of our website to download our 2020 sustainability report for more details. Please reach out for any questions. With that, I'll turn tthey call over to Bob to discuss Q1 financial results in more detail. Robert Barton  Good morning, and thank you, Ernest and Adam. Last night, we reported first quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.38, first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.02.  I believe it is important to note that tthey FFO in tthey first quarter includes a charge of approximately $4.3 million for tthey early extinguishment of our $150 million Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series A, which were due on October 31, 2021. Without tthey charge for tthey early extinguishment of debt, our first quarter 2021 FFO per share would have been approximately $0.44. From a financial perspective, it was a relatively quiet quarter. I am not going to spend a lot of time on anything that has already eittheyr been discussed or is in tthey earnings release and save time for tthey follow-up questions. We did end up close to our expectations based on tthey current environment. Same-store metrics are down in retail as expected and office was also lower for tthey quarter, but it is expected to end with 8% or greater same-store cash NOI for tthey year ended 2021. I'll now turn tthey call over to Steve Center, our Vice President of Office Properties for a brief update on our office segment. Steve? Steve Center  Thanks, Bob. At tthey end of tthey first quarter, net of One Beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 94% leased with just 3.4% expiring through tthey end of 2021. Our top 10 office tenants represented 50.2% of our total office base rent.  Given tthey quality of our assets and tthey strength of tthey markets in which ttheyy are located with technology and life science as tthey key market drivers, our office portfolio has weattheyred tthey crisis well. Current stats by region are as follows: Bellevue is 96.5% leased; Portland is 97.1% leased; San Francisco is 100% leased, net of One Beach; and San Diego is 89.1% leased with two buildings under renovation at Torrey Reserve, making up 5.8% of San Diego's vacancy and 2.6% of tthey office portfolio's vacancy.  Our strategy of offering lease term flexibility while preserving pre-COVID rental rates produced 36 comparable new and renewal leases over tthey last 12 months totaling 182,000 rentable square feet with a weighted average increase of 8.9% over prior rents on a cash basis and 16.9% on a straight-line basis. Tthey weighted average lease term was 3.3 years with just $8.7 per rental square foot in TIs and incentives. We experienced limited small tenant attrition due to COVID and ottheyr business challenges during tthey quarter resulting in a net loss of approximately 31,000 rentable square feet, none of which was lost to a competitor.  However, smaller tenant activity has picked up significantly with tenants willing to commit to longer-term leases at favorable rental rates. Even more encouraging is tthey push to return to tthey office and tthey emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality larger blocks of space in select markets including San Diego and Bellevue.  We continue to strategically invest in our current portfolio through renovation, redevelopment, and ground-up developments. Tthey renovation at two of tthey 14 buildings at Torrey Reserve should be complete ttheir summer. In tthey process, we are enhancing tthey campus amenities and aggregating large blocks of space in tthey Del Mar Heights submarket to meet demand and take advantage of pricing power.  Construction has commenced on a redevelopment of One Beach Street in San Francisco with delivery in tthey first half of 2022 and construction is nearly complete on a redevelopment of 710 Oregon Square in tthey Lloyd sub-market of Portland. One Beach will grow to over 102,000 square feet and 710 Oregon Square will add more than 33,000 square feet to our office portfolio. Construction is also commenced on Tower 3 at La Jolla Commons, a 213,000 square foot, 11 story Class A plus office tower in tthey UTC submarket of San Diego with expected completion in Q2 to Q3 of 2023. We are encouraged by tthey emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space in UTC. We are optimistic about our office portfolio as we move forward into tthey rest of 2021 and beyond. Operator, I'll now turn tthey call over to you for questions. Question-And-Answer Session  Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt  Thank you. Ernest Rady  Good morning, Craig. Craig Schmidt  Hey, how are you?  Ernest Rady  I am good.  Craig Schmidt  Good. How has tthey retail leasing environment been since tthey end of March? So, tthey first four weeks or so of April, can you describe wtheyre we coming to – with - I guess, much of tthey California hope? Ernest Rady  I mean, we are going to ask Chris Sullivan to answer that. He has been in tthey midst of it and they us our internal expert and external, as well. Chris Sullivan  Good morning, Craig. Leasing definitely picked up, exactly picked up since tthey 4th of March in respect to – more phone calls ttheyy real big part of our retailers starting to look for space, starting to show a step-up. It's now it like obviously in 2019. But it is starting to pick up toward and starting to go on. So I am way more optimistic now than I was a year ago. Does that theylp answer your question? Craig Schmidt  Right. So, I mean, it still sounds like it's generally improved since tthey beginning of tthey year. Chris Sullivan  Yes. It's generally improving. It really got focused back as California didn't pop open with tthey indoor dining. And if you look at so many of tthey shopping centers throughout tthey country now, quite a bit of dining, you can almost consider that category in anchor tenants. But in California that didn't pop back open to indoor until middle of March.  So if that's opened up tthey registers are starting to ramp you see. Especially theyre in San Diego, you see a lot of weekend tourism. So, you see – you're starting to see tthey more aggressive retailers or tthey savvy retailers of tthey restaurant tours are now around looking for space and I think tthey results of that wtheyn you actually see that getting maybe four to six months from now. But tthey graph is starting to sprout back up on tthey deals is tthey way I would describe it. Craig Schmidt  Great. And ttheyn, I was wondering if you are experiencing much in terms of cost increases on your development and redevelopment projects. Are ttheyy possibly impacting tthey yield? Ernest Rady  I am going to ask Jerry Gammieri to handle that. He handles our construction and they is involved on a day-to-day basis with tthey investments.  Jerry Gammieri  Sure. Craig, thank you for tthey question. We are seeing cost increases in tthey construction industry as a whole. Year-over-year, it has gone up. We were very successful in tthey buys that we made in our three major projects with tthey 710 Oregon Square building, tthey One Beach project and La Jolla Commons.  I think, Ernest had asked me a question yesterday that, if I had to go out and buy La Jolla Commons today in today's dollars, how much more would it cost us to build it versus wtheyn we started negotiating those fees a year ago during tthey pandemic. And I would venture to say that it would probably be as much as about 15% above what we have bought today. So, I hope that answers your question. Chris Sullivan  Great. And ttheyn, and just finally on tthey Asian lifting tourism, is that really what required to return Hawaii to theylp or can an increase in tthey domestic travel somewhat mitigate tthey disruption? Ernest Rady  Domestic travel would theylp for sure. But that's tthey cake, tthey icing on tthey cake is tthey Asian travel. Chris Sullivan  Okay. Great. Thank you. Ernest Rady  Thank you, Greg. Thanks for your interest. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ernest Rady  Good morning, Todd. Todd Thomas  Hi. Good morning. Just first question on tthey multifamily segment, you saw a nice increase in occupancy in Portland. Has that continued into April? And can you comment on tthey decrease in rents and tthey use of concessions to drive traffic ttheyre? Ernest Rady  That's been very tough, frankly in Portland and we had a management issue, which we solved immediately wtheyn it came to our attention. We are now having to give concessions, which are painful. But tthey biggest cost of operating real estate as vacancy and we'd sooner have somebody in ttheyre than have it vacant. But we hope that Portland will return to normal. But if you read tthey newspapers, you'll see what turbulence Portland has been subject to and we have not been an exception. Todd Thomas  Okay. Should we expect to see tthey concessions burn off in tthey second and third quarters and drive tthey face rents higtheyr and as tthey occupancy increases, is that continuing? Ernest Rady  Todd, I'd like to tell you, I know, but I really don't know. I've never been through a circumstance like Portland before. I'll tell you ttheir though, we'll do as well as anybody in tthey market. We have a team in place ttheyy are who have been with us for a number of years. We have just hired a new project manager. Sthey comes very, very experienced and we will do as well as anybody. And Portland will have to return to normal before our rental income returns to more normal levels, is what I believe. Todd Thomas  Okay. And ttheyn…  Ernest Rady  Any disagree? Go atheyad. Todd Thomas  Okay. I also – I wanted to ask about tthey retail segment and tthey 2022 NOI bridge that you provided in your latest corporate presentation. Tthey retail cash NOI in tthey quarter was a little over $60 million. So $65 million annualized, I think and that's atheyad of tthey 2022 projection for retail cash NOI, which was $63 million.  I don't know if ttheyre is some deferred rent that was collected in tthey quarter, which I think was referenced in tthey prepared remarks. But Bob, can you theylp us sort of unpack tthey retail NOI in tthey quarter a little bit and maybe theylp us understand how that's tracking relative to prior projections? Robert Barton  Yes. I mean, I think we're pretty close to what our presentation is – our quarterly presentation, Todd. And I think really what it points to is that, and tthey way we look at it is that 2022 is really tthey recovery year, because in 2022, you continue to outperform and tthey growth of tthey office cash NOI, plus tthey mixed use, which we think is going to be strong in 2022, which should take you from a total cash NOI of around $211 million, increasing up to a total of around $250 million plus.  So, we think 2022 is recovery year. But in terms of unpacking 2021 or ttheir quarter, I think we are still on track. I think, if not, even more so. Todd Thomas  Right. Okay, because it seems like tthey retail ttheir quarter is already atheyad on an annualized basis of wtheyre you expect it to be in 2022. So I didn't know if you are anticipating some move-outs or a decrease in cash NOI for retail that might take some time to recover ttheyn over tthey next several quarters. Robert Barton  No. We are just going to have to play that out, but I think we are still on track with tthey unofficial guidance in Q4 that we issued. If you go back and take a look at that. But ttheyre is nothing that really step that that points to anything different than that. Obviously, some of tthey collections – Adam had mentioned on their script, that 88% of tthey deferred rent has been collected, which is positive. So that's starting to come in as well, which I think is additive to that. Todd Thomas  Okay. All right, great. Just one last question if I could. I'll hop off. I was just wondering if ttheyre was an update at Landmark related to tthey Autodesk expirations that occur later in 2022 and 2023. Not sure if it's too early, but if ttheyre is any update ttheyre, that’d be great. Ernest Rady  No update at ttheir time except ttheyy just gone through extensive renovation of ttheyir second and fourth floors. Tthey second floor is a space that expires at tthey end of next year with tthey remainder in 2023 and what was tthey investment ttheyre? Steve Center  We are investing upwards of $450 a foot. Ernest Rady  About $15 million. And we just toured it on last Tuesday and site. So ttheyy are investing in ttheyir space, which I think is a good indicator of ttheyir commitment to tthey building, because of Landmark and One Market and we wanted to see what our tenants are spending and one of tthey – ttheyy are spending almost a $100 million ttheyir own money on tthey building and tthey ottheyr one is spending over $15 million. So, we are pretty happy with that investment in tthey short run and tthey long run. I wish we had five of ttheym. Todd Thomas  All right. Thank you. Adam Wyll  It's a great building. Thanks for tthey questions. Thank you, Todd. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ernest Rady  Good morning, Richard. Ron Kamdem  Hey, you got Ron Kamdem on for Richard Hill.  Ernest Rady  Okay. Well, tell Richard, we think we are better off with you than them. Ron Kamdem  That's right. And just – tthey first question was just going to tthey office portfolio. Maybe could you touch on tthey same-store NOI ttheir quarter. I saw it’s almost down maybe what happened ttheyre? And actually just a bigger picture question which is, just what are you theyaring from sort of tthey office tenants and return to tthey office? Ernest Rady  Well to answer your first question, that negative was due to one deal and it was a business decision to keep us a law firm in 17,000 feet. Ttheyre are 24,000 foot full floor law firm and ttheyy had subleased about 7,000 feet of ttheyir space to somebody else and that subtenant have moved out. So ttheyre lease was coming up and ttheyy went to tthey market and found a competing space about tthey same size of $3.10 a foot.  We looked at tthey price – comments was false. We looked at tthey prospect of losing a 17,000 foot law firm and we decided to keep ttheym wtheyre ttheyy are, not put in a corridor, no TIs and tthey competing space was a $3.10 a foot, ttheyy agreed to stay at $5 a square foot. So that was a victory for us. We had to take a hit on square footage. And that's what happened. Now just to add to that, ttheyy are paying 35.6% more in rental rates than ttheyy were at lease expiration. So we think it's a good business decision in a full building to keep 17,000 foot law firm. Chris Sullivan  Excuse me. Ron, in terms of your question on tthey same-store cash NOI for tthey office, it’s primarily because of our government tenants up in 1st of May. We still had through Q1 abatements that were incurred ttheyre. So that reduced your cash NOI by close to $1 million bucks.  Ernest Rady  To answer your question on back to work, we've got a number of firms coming back. We have a life science firm right across from us theyre that that came back ttheir past Monday and ottheyrs are making plans to come back in tthey next few months. So we are encouraged by that and ttheyn you can read what Google is doing and ottheyr big technology firms are doing. That’s sure what we are theyaring is that ttheyre is a big push to get back to tthey office. Ron Kamdem  Great. That's theylpful. And ttheyn, if I could sort of – tthey second question was just on sort of tthey mixed used assets in Hawaii and so forth, obviously, tthey NOI is still sort of flat to slightly negative in tthey quarter. I remember, I think three months ago, you sort of felt that ttheyre was a decent shy of a recovery in tthey second half of tthey year. Just curious how you guys are feeling or thinking about Waikiki and tthey recovery ttheyre on tthey mixed-use stuff? Ernest Rady  Ron, everybody I talk to is looking forward to tthey end of ttheir pandemic and getting back to a normal life. And particularly, people feel deprived that ttheyy can't travel. Now if you're going to travel, you're going to go to someplace safe and Hawaii is safe. So, I am as confident as I can be that Hawaii is going to return to pre-pandemic levels.  I just don't know exactly wtheyn, but it's going to happen. If I had tthey opportunity, I'd buy everything in Hawaii all over again. It's a great property in a great location and I am looking forward to tthey recovery. Chris Sullivan  Yes. Ron, just to add to Earnest comments. We are – in terms of our estimation, it's not tthey timing, but we do believe that tthey back half of 2021 we're going to see an increase over tthey first half. I know that, wtheyn I look at tthey Embassy Suites, our booking phase, and I take a look at that, our expectation is that we will be 79% or higtheyr in June. People are ready to travel. Ernest Rady  Ourselves included. Chris Sullivan  Yes. Ron Kamdem  Great, that's theylpful. That's all my questions. Thank you. Ernest Rady  Okay. Thanks, Ron. Say a word to Richard. Operator I am not showing any furttheyr questions at ttheir time. I would now like to turn tthey call back over to Ernest Rady, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Ernest Rady  To sum it all up, we've come through ttheir terrible turmoil in excellent shape everything considered. And I know that you are all familiar with tthey fact that we used to borrow money on a private placement basis and private placements became more expensive than public issuance. So, we thought we try tthey public issuance market.  We offered $500 million of 10-year bonds and we were 4.5 times oversubscribed and so we now have tthey proceeds of that issue and after paying off some debt and earmarking some of that proceeds for tthey improvement of tthey properties which we've discussed. We are looking forward to investing that money in additional assets, which we are going to do our best to make sure that are accretive for our stockholders.  So, I know that you can’t count on it, but one thing you can count on, we'll do our best for you and we appreciate your confidence and thank you for your interest. Operator Ttheir concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
