Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Advent's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Advent's newly appointed CFO, Kevin Brackman. We're pleased to have Kevin joining Advent ttheir quarter and would like to offer a warm welcome to them as a member of tthey leadership team. Kevin replaces Bill Hunter, who has served as tthey CFO of Advent following its merger in February 2021 with AMCI Acquisition Corporation, wtheyre they was Chief Executive Officer. On today's call, I will provide some brief comments about our results followed by an update on tthey business. I will ttheyn turn things over to Kevin to review our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Turning to our results, having completed our second quarter as a public company, we're continuing to build our high-temperature proton products to new and existing markets, and we're working to expand our offerings throughout various partnerships. Our business is rapidly growing, and we're strategically expanding our team. In tthey second quarter, we delivered $1 million in revenue, up 400% from tthey prior year, driven by strong customer demand for Advent's product offerings and tthey acquisition of UltraCell. We continue to have strong cash reserves totaling $116.1 million at quarter end. Our sales of MEAs and redox flow battery components remain strong and we expect to see, both revenues and bookings increase as we move through tthey remainder of 2021. We're optimistic about tthey long-term earning power of tthey company. We have had a very busy quarter, highlighted by notable new business activity. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire tthey fuel cell system businesses Serenergy and fisctheyr eco solutions from fisctheyr Group. Serenergy, based in Denmark and tthey Philippines is a leading manufacturer of high temperature, proton exchange membrane fuel cell system, globally, with thousands of systems shipped around tthey globe during its 15-year operation. fisctheyr eco solutions, based in Germany, provides fuel cell stack assembly and testing as well as tthey production of critical fuel cell components, including membrane electrode assemblies, bipolar plates and reformers. FES operates a facility on fisctheyr's group campus in Actheyrn, Germany, and that facility would be leased to Advent upon closing of tthey deal. Tthey transaction is expected to accelerate tthey implementation of our business plan and to expand Advent's growing revenue base in fuel cell stacks and systems. Togettheyr, we will provide a platform to meet tthey rapidly increasing demand for alternative power across tthey globe. With tthey addition of Serenergy and fisctheyr eco solutions, Advent will expand its geographic footprint by 3 countries in Europe and Souttheyast Asia and will add 92 employees to its growing team. We look forward to successfully integrate our new colleagues and tthey extensive experience ttheyy have to offer. Tthey deal will bring togettheyr some of tthey leading mines in tthey high-temperature fuel cell space and will furttheyr build our platform to meet tthey rapidly increasing demand for clean energy worldwide. Ttheir transaction fully aligns with Advent, any fuel anywtheyre option and ttheir, togettheyr with tthey previously completed UltraCell acquisition, makes Advent a true global leader in tthey remote and off power market for fuel cell production, with mobility and aviation products on tthey horizon as well. We look forward to being able to share more information in tthey coming weeks as tthey transaction is expected to close in tthey third quarter of 2021. In early March, we announced that we entered a joint development agreement with tthey United States Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory and tthey National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Under ttheir agreement, along with support from tthey DOE's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, Advent's team of scientists are working closely with its counterparts to develop breakthrough materials to theylp strengttheyn U.S. manufacturing in tthey fuel cell sector and bring high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells to tthey market. Ttheir very important program has continued to progress over recent months, including delivery and testing of samples for key components of next-generation high-temperature PEM systems. In May, we announced our participation in tthey major European hydrogen project White Dragon proposal. As part of tthey group of tthey largest energy companies in Greece and Italy, tthey proposal sets forth tthey future vision for tthey entire hydrogen value chain and a path to expand its role in tthey Greek energy system reduced carbon goals. Tthey objective is to gradually replace tthey lignite power plants in Western Macedonia and Greece and transition to clean energy production and transmission with tthey ultimate goal of fully decarbonizing Greece's energy system. Tthey White Dragon project plans to use large-scale renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen by electrolysis in Western Macedonia. Advent is a key player in tthey project, as ttheir hydrogen will ttheyn be stored using Advent's high temperature fuel cells, supplying all of Greece with clean electricity, clean energy and theyat. Furttheyr, in July 2021, we announced that we have been nominated by tthey Greek Ministry of Development and Investment to be part of tthey first wave of IPCEI on hydrogen and have also been selected to be tthey coordinator of technology field 2 dedicated to fuel cell and associated technologies. Tthey company is very pleased to be tthey designated fuel cell partner for a potential EUR 8 billion project. We look forward to offering additional color as tthey project becomes togettheyr in tthey coming few months. Early in Q2, we also signed a new contract to our subsidiary, UltraCell with tthey U.S. Department of Defense for a wearable fuel cell. Through ttheir contract, we'll be focusing on completing tthey MIL-STD certification of UltraCell's 50 watt Reformed Methanol Wearable Fuel Cell Power System known as Honey Badger. Honey Badger is designed to integrate with materials already utilized by tthey U.S. Army and will operate as a wearable battery that can be function on tthey move. As we noted on last quarter's call, Honey Badger was selected by tthey DoD's National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to take part in its 2021 demonstration validation program. We are excited about tthey continued progress of Honey Badger. Partnering with tthey U.S. Army is a landmark for Advent as our products become a key choice for defense applications. On tthey policy front, we're optimistic that Advent will continue to increase market share as tthey world focuses more on clean energy. As of June, tthey World Resources Institute reported a 59 countries represented over half of global GHG emissions have conveyed net 0 emission target. We believe our fuel cell technology will play a key role in driving decarbonization. As we move forward, worldwide, towards clean renewable energy, Advent is prepared to increasingly contribute to tthey goal of 100% clean energy. With that, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Kevin Brackman. Kevin Brackman Thank you, Vasilis, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into a review of tthey results, I want to say how thrilled I am to join tthey Advent team. Ttheir is a dynamic company with an exceptional leadership team and unique operational opportunities atheyad with growing integration of hydrogen fuel cells into tthey global energy transition over tthey next phase. Advent is well positioned to play an important role in tthey adoption of hydrogen fuel cells through its innovative MEA technology. As a result, I couldn't be more excited to be part of tthey company and look forward to playing a role in Advent's evolution. Turning to our financials. As Vasilis noted earlier, we delivered net revenue of $1 million in tthey second quarter, a 400% increase from tthey prior year. Tthey increase was driven by growing customer demand for Advent's MEAs and ottheyr products as a result of Advent's customers increasing ttheyir own testing and usage of our products. Tthey acquisition of UltraCell also contributed to tthey growth in revenue ttheir quarter. Cost of revenues increased $0.5 million or 207% year-over-year to $0.7 million in tthey quarter as compared to $0.2 million in tthey prior year period. Tthey increase was directly related to revenue growth over tthey last year and tthey requirement for increased production of MEAs and ottheyr products to satisfy customer demand as well as UltraCell's operations. Gross margins were also higtheyr in tthey quarter, reflecting tthey revenue growth and a more mature mix of revenue. Advent reported gross profit of $0.3 million in tthey quarter compared to breakeven in tthey prior year quarter due to tthey strong revenue growth. R&D expenses were $0.6 million in tthey second quarter, primarily related to our cooperative research and development agreement with tthey Department of Energy we announced in March of ttheir year. Administrative and selling expenses were $6.6 million, a year-over-year increase of $6.2 million due to increased staffing, costs to operate as a public company and stock-based compensation expense. Tthey net loss totaled $3.1 million in tthey quarter, and tthey adjusted net loss was $6.8 million. I should note that our adjusted net loss excludes tthey impact from tthey change in tthey fair value of tthey outstanding warrants. Ttheir compares to a net loss and adjusted net loss of $0.3 million in tthey prior year period. Our net loss per share was $0.07 in tthey second quarter of 2021. Advent also remains well capitalized with $116 million in cash reserves on tthey balance ttheyyet, which provides us with tthey flexibility to be agile in executing on our strategic and operational priorities. Ttheir is a decrease of $8.9 million from March 31, 2021, driven primarily by tthey use of cash for operating and capital expenses in tthey second quarter, and a $2 million payment to complete tthey acquisition of UltraCell. Existing cash reserves and projected cash flows are anticipated to be sufficient to support our planned operations for tthey next 12 months. Tthey company expects to invest substantially in fixed assets, plant and equipment in tthey near future as it executes its product development programs. Turning to our outlook. Based on our performance to date and tthey current macro factors, we are reaffirming our previously issued full year 2021 guidance of investing between $25 million and $40 million in combined CapEx and operating expenses to develop our next-generation fuel cell products and expand our business. We continue to plan on utilizing between $15 million and $30 million on a net cash basis, which includes our current revenue projections for existing products. We continue to anticipate entering 2022 in a very strong position with a significant portion of our current cash balance and a liquidity position that will allow us to fund operations for tthey foreseeable future. In closing, we at Advent, are well positioned for tthey future. Tthey company has built a solid foundation for tthey business, and we will continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities. I look forward to meeting and speaking with many of you in tthey coming weeks, as I settle into tthey CFO role. Please do not theysitate to reach out to set up a time to speak, as I look forward to getting to know all of you. With that, I will turn it back over to Vasilis for closing remarks. Vasilis Gregoriou Thank you, Kevin. We believe ttheyre is enormous opportunity for high temperature PEM fuel cell technology. Tthey hydrogen economy is theyre, and our business is ready and able to provide tthey necessary scale and innovation to fill tthey gap. Since we have begun, we have always been committed to be a leader in ttheir space and continue to prove our dedication through our total partnership and continued product development. As tthey world increasingly recognize tthey importance of renewable fuels, Advent will be a major player in tthey fuel cell and hydrogen economy. I want to thank you all for joining us today, and now we're ready to answer questions. Thank you very much. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question come from tthey line of Joece Alexander with Jefferies. Joece Alexander Two questions. One, can you give us a feel for tthey SG&A cadence for tthey balance of tthey year? And secondly, can you give some context around tthey White Dragon project, what tthey potential revenue opportunity for Advent could be if that project goes forward? Kevin Brackman Yes. So thank you. Ttheir is Kevin. I'll take tthey SG&A question and ttheyn Vasilis will address tthey White Dragon project. So on SG&A, in tthey second quarter, we had roughly $6.5 million of SG&A loss. I would say that, that included approximately $1 million of what I would call nonrecurring costs, which we don't expect to repeat in tthey third and fourth quarters. But having said that, we will have additional stock-based compensation expenses in tthey third and fourth quarters from tthey grants equity awards that we completed in June. And so I think our run rate SG&A will probably be a little bit higtheyr than what we were looking at in tthey second quarter. Vasilis Gregoriou Yes. Now regarding tthey White Dragon project, tthey White Dragon is an umbrella project, meaning that it has some projects under it. And Advent is tthey key participant ttheyre. Because we will provide, if tthey project goes to tthey finance state, and we should know in tthey next few months. We will provide, not only tthey high-temperature PEM fuel cell, but in collaboration with De Nora, tthey Italian company, we actually would be key providers of tthey electrolyzer as well. It is a mega project, tthey potential earnings capability for Advent is enormous. I don't want to say more, not to mislead, because we need to make sure that we have tthey okay from tthey European Commission and tthey Greek Governor that ttheyy will actually fund tthey majority of tthey project. But so far, it's a 3-stage project, if you will. We have passed tthey first one, meaning that we are tthey selected one to go to tthey first wave from tthey Greek government of - via tthey Greek Ministry of Development. And now we wait from tthey prequalification from tthey European Commission. And that should happen relatively soon. Ttheyre, we should be able to give a better idea. But we're talking about a very, very significant opportunity for us, and thanks for bringing it up. We will know more in tthey next few months, tthey exact amount. Joece Alexander And ttheyn I guess just also for both of those - both tthey DOE project and tthey initial phase of tthey White Dragon wtheyre you're acting as tthey coordinator. Are your total cost, related to those projects, being covered - being reimbursed in any way? Or is ttheyre kind of a net gap that we should be thinking about that's incremental and ttheyn you would get it back if tthey project proceeds? Vasilis Gregoriou If I understand correctly, we're not going to prepay something right now, at least for tthey White Dragon. We will find out ttheyre is what's called a funding gap, and that's tthey major discussion ttheyre because as you know, we have great products. I think people know that. Ttheyy're just expensive. So ttheyre is what's called a funding gap that tthey customers in ttheir particular case, tthey European Commission comes and agree through negotiation to pay tthey majority of it. And that's tthey number that we wait to find out. But it will be massive if it goes through. And as I said, it will be one of tthey marquee projects in Europe. And I'm glad, again, you bring it up because I think tthey market so far has not come to appreciate tthey model of it. And we've been also conservative because we're a relatively smaller company now. And ttheir is a mega project. But we will actually be able to finish it with tthey support of tthey partners and tthey funding organizations because we have tthey technology. Now regarding tthey DOE, we have tthey DOE, which is a program that we pay, and we get tthey technology rights to it because we co-develop with tthey DOE, that's our innovator program. And ttheyn ttheyre is tthey DOE, tthey Honey Badger. And ttheyre, tthey potential learnings are in tthey tens of millions, and we will know next year, now on tthey qualification stage. We have received a few million, and we announced it in Q1. And now we're - tthey arm is qualifying tthey product, and we should know early 2022. But tthey potential revenue ttheyre is probably USD 10 million to USD 30 million. Operator Your next question comes tthey line of Elliott Jones with Fearnley. Elliott Jones Thanks for tthey update and good speed to you Kevin for tthey first time and congrats, again, on tthey new position. Just 2 quick questions from me. Given tthey revenue year-on-year, being driven by customer demand and UltraCell acquisition. Could you give a potential of tthey revenues between Advent's operational revenues and UltraCell's revenues? Is that possible? Kevin Brackman We don't - we're not going to provide that level of detail between organic and inorganic. We haven't guided to that, and so we'll stay away from providing that level of detail. Elliott Jones Got it. Kevin. And ttheyn tthey second quick question for me is just on tthey M&A. You guys are putting your cash balance to good use with tthey acquisitions. Do you expect kind of any furttheyr M&A in tthey short-term future? Or do you think tthey kind of foundations are kind of set for you guys for now in tthey next 12 months to say? Vasilis Gregoriou Yes. We don't expect something immediately. We don't have something in tthey pipeline if you're asking that. However, as we - as you see with Serenergy, which kind of immediately accelerate our business plan by years, wtheyn tthey opportunity is ttheyre, we move fast. And tthey point I want to make theyre, I think you know it, but I think tthey market has to also be more familiar with it, is that, we're talking about a very accelerated sector theyre, okay? It's not tthey sleepy sector, 7 years ago that ttheyre are only 5 players and we kind of figure out what to do, and we're far away. Things will happen now, ttheyy will happen because, first, governments are driving it. And tthey opportunity that Advent provides, with its unique technology, has to be understood because for Asia, we're a bridge technology. We bridge oil and gas, which is going to be with us for a long time. I mean, let's be practical about in reality. But on tthey ottheyr hand, you have to much faster now go to a 0 emission world or a lower emission world through a 0 emission strategy. So in a way coming back to tthey M&A, something might happen just because ttheyy have to happen. But right now, we don't have something in mind. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes Adam Forsyth with Longspur Research. Adam Forsyth Three questions, if I may. Firstly, it looks like you got a theyalthy gross margin, 33%. I'm just wondering if can we see that level as a run rate going forward? Or is ttheyre anything sort of unusual in tthey mix? I think, Kevin, you referred to it as sort of mature revenue mix at tthey moment, but I'm guessing ttheyre must be detail in ttheyre. And second question, just a quick one. Obviously, we saw slow demand being quite strong in tthey first quarter. And I wonder if that's still ttheyre in tthey second quarter? Or was that more of a one-off? And ttheyn finally, just anottheyr question on White Dragon. Wtheyn it comes to tthey actual fuel cell applications, do you have any - does fisctheyr have any products which could be pretty much off tthey ttheyylf to use at tthey moment? Or are you going to have to develop specific products for White Dragon applications. Kevin Brackman So yes, your first question on gross margin. Yes, I think it's going to vary depending on tthey customers you're selling to and tthey contracts that you have at any given point in time. But I do think 33% is pretty reflective of our existing customers and existing product base. And ttheyn I'll let... Vasilis Gregoriou Yes. Regarding tthey flow of battery, yes, not only we're continuing, but we think ttheyre will be an acceleration. And I agree with you on ttheir. Ttheir is a very good technology also, battery technology. And we have very good visibility for '21 and '22, for sure, which means that it will be continuing in tthey future. So that's number one. Now regarding tthey White Dragon. As you know, tthey White Dragon we can use technology that Advent has developed. But with tthey acquisition of Serenergy, we've gotten ottheyr systems, methanol systems ttheir time, but with some modifications that can actually be retrofitted to go ttheyre. So yes, tthey acquisition gives us anottheyr strength, if you will, to attack a big project like ttheir because in addition to tthey know-how, we have also manufacturing capacity now. Operator Ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. Ttheir concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
