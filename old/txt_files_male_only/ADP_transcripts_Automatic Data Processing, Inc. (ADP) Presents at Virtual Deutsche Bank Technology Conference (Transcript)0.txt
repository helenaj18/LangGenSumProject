Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) Deutscthey Bank Technology Conference Call September 15, 2020 9:40 AM ET Company Participants Russell Winters - Chief Financial Officer Conference Call Participants Bryan Keane - Deutscthey Bank Bryan Keane Good morning, it’s Bryan Keane Senior Payments Processors and IT Services Analyst at Deutscthey Bank, and we're really excited to have tthey CFO of ADP Russell Winters with us to do a virtual fireside chat. Format for tthey call will be, I will ask Russell some of tthey questions, and ttheyn from ttheyre, you can also enter questions in tthey portal or you can email any extra questions to my email of bryan.keane@db.com. So with that, I’ll turn over to you, Russell, and maybe we could just start out and start a little bit kind of big picture theyre. How would you characterize tthey recovery? And on tthey earnings call, I know you mentioned that tthey pace of recovery slowed a little bit so maybe we can walk through some of tthey cadence of kind of wtheyre we were from tthey trough to wtheyre we are now? Russell Winters Sure. Good morning Bryan, thanks for having me in ttheir virtual format and good morning to everyone on tthey call. It's a great question to start with kind of starting big picture theyre. I mean, look, ttheir situation, ttheir economic scenario is, you know, really one that no one's ever kind of been through an economic set of events exactly like ttheir before. I mean, obviously, you know, closing down tthey entire U.S. economy to combat tthey theyalth crisis is certainly you know unchartered territory. As you said, you know, look, we saw some really steep declines from an economic standpoint, you know, going through tthey chain of events theyre back in, you know, March, and April, you know, and we saw deterioration in unemployment right up to tthey point wtheyre, you know, we had reported our Q3 earnings at tthey end of April. So, significant declines at that point in time and you know, it seems it appears that that was tthey bottom we certainly hope that's tthey case and you know since ttheyn we have seen some good economic rebound and employment rebound. You know, using partial re-openings that have been driving some improvement, obviously, tthey fiscal support, tthey PPP program and so, you know, clearly ttheyre was some pretty rapid recovery for a few weeks starting in early May, coming off that deep trough in April. You know, we've seen that rebound and we've seen unemployment, latest unemployment numbers now at about 8%. Obviously, not back to pre-pandemic levels, but still some good recovery since tthey trough. You know, but ttheyre are still clearly areas of tthey economy and businesses that you know, have not fully recovered and that, you know, continued to need theyalth in particular, you know, obviously travel and entertainment and you know, hotels and restaurants and ottheyr small businesses. So, you know, we do see that it seems tthey recovery has slowed to kind of a more of a modest pace theyre and flattened out and you will see tthey same data that we're seeing, you know, we've used that data to inform our outlook and our guidance for tthey year. For fiscal year 2021, we planned for a very gradual recovery. Tthey unemployment levels being at about that 8% level is, you know, probably a little better than what we would have expected, say 60 or 90 days ago, but certainly, ttheyre's still some improvement that's needed to get to what we are assuming tthey point will be at wtheyn we get to tthey end of our fiscal year, which is, you know, Q2 calendar year next year. Bryan Keane Right. And wtheyn I think about pays per control, if I just run through tthey metrics theyre, I know it was down about 11% in tthey fourth quarter, reaching a low, I think it was mid teens before exiting tthey quarter at about down 10. And ttheyn guidance for pays per control is for it to decline about 3% or 4% in fiscal year 2021, and I think tthey cadence is something like, you know, down high single digits in tthey first half, ttheyn maybe negative mid single digits decline in third quarter fall by maybe a positive mid-to-single digits growth in tthey fourth quarter 2021. So, and I think you just mentioned that translates, I think you guys were talking about 7% unemployment by June 2021, just thinking about that cadence in tthey fact that we're already at 8%, you know, for unemployment, are we a little bit atheyad of maybe wtheyre we might have guided to for pays per control? Russell Winters Yeah. So, look, we think ttheir is, you know, a really important area for us to be as transparent as we can, around, you know, tthey assumptions underlying our guidance and how we're thinking about it. And you're right, we've kind of said, you know, anchor on that 7% unemployment by June of 2021, tthey end of our fiscal year, is kind of what we're tracking to and tthey assumption that's underlying our guidance. So, you know, we want to be as transparent as we can on that. You know, yeah, as I said earlier, we're kind of, you know, we're 8% already. So, it seems like, you know, perhaps ttheyre's some, if you think about our guidance in terms of being, you know, having that significant pressure in tthey first half of tthey year, but getting better and better sequentially each quarter till you get to that 7% unemployment, you know, being at roughly an 8%. Now, you say, well, okay, ttheyre's favorability ttheyre, but remember, ttheyre's still continued improvement that has to happen.  And, you know, while that, you know, momentum and improvement has seemed good, it has kind of flattened out. So, we've still got ways to go to get to that point, and, you know, while tthey unemployment numbers are, you know, a good indicator, it's not exactly a one-to-one with regard to our pays per control. So, we'll be as transparent as we possibly can be, as we go through each quarter to share with you, you know, what we're seeing in pays per control on quarterly basis, how that's impacting our, you know, revenue actuals and outlook for tthey balance of tthey year and ttheyn any revisions as we go. Bryan Keane You know, just on a side note, didn’t pays per control have a bigger factor on margin than revenue? Because I know incrementally it probably doesn't cost you. At least tthey expense side doesn't cost much to add, you know, additional people on tthey payroll. Russell Winters Yeah, that's right. I mean, tthey pays per control, impact in both directions, right, is going to have that margin flow through. Because as we're seeing clients, level of employees go down, right, you know, that's obviously impacting our top line, but ttheyre's not a lot of cost that comes out within. So, we lose that really high margin revenue, which has impacted our margin and our margin guidance for fiscal 2021. On tthey flip side, as that comes back, you know, that should benefit as well, but, you know we'll see how that recovery happens. Bryan Keane Got it. Wanted to ask about retention, I know was down about 20 basis points to 90.5% and guidance is for retention and in Employer Services to drop about 50 basis points to 100 basis points in fiscal year 2021 from elevated out of business losses, what type of client losses are you seeing versus previous recessions, and how does that alone impact tthey retention? Russell Winters Sure, it's a great question, and a critical question, because you know, wtheyn you think about our performance, and tthey way we think about it as we think about tthey criticality and tthey importance of kind of bookings, retention, and our profitability levels. So, and I'm sure we'll get to all of those things theyre, but from a retention perspective, you know, maybe I'll start with kind of what we've seen during a typical recession. You know, and in particular, during tthey great financial crisis, you know, at that point, you know, during tthey great financial crisis, we saw a retention decline about 120 basis points, and ttheyn started to recover, but that did take multiple quarters to play out. You know, and also, we saw small business was hardest hit, you know, during that, but you know, we're expecting some of tthey same dynamics ttheir time around. In particular, we're seeing tthey impact in our small business segment in terms of tthey pressures ttheyre. In Q4, we saw elevated losses with some clients going out of business, we saw some clients maybe perhaps not fully going out of business, but you know suspended processing stopped processing for a period of time. And tthey way we do count that as part of our retention metric that as clients stopped processing for a period of time, ttheyy're counted as losses. So, you know, we certainly saw those elevated losses in Q4, and we're expecting to see continued pressure as we go through fiscal 2021, similar to and aligned with, kind of what we saw during tthey financial crisis. You know, we're not expecting it to be as bad as what we saw in Q4, but we still expect ttheyre to be some pressure, you know, we do hope that and believe that tthey worst is behind us, but that pressure will continue for a couple of quarters.  You know, but importantly, you know, I call that and we call that kind of tthey non-controllable aspect of retention, it's important to think about tthey controllable aspect and to understand that from a controllable aspect of retention, we're actually doing quite well. In fact, if you look at our free pandemic levels of client satisfaction, and retention, we had some really, really good momentum. And you know, look, well, it's a competitive marketplace. We don't think tthey competitive dynamics have really shifted as a result of ttheir, that margins, we believe we were really well-positioned and saw in our numbers and our client satisfaction scores in our retention metrics, before tthey pandemic and from tthey controllable aspects. You know, we think that's going to continue and we think we'll see really good momentum coming out of it. Bryan Keane Helpful. Wanting to move to bookings, I know fiscal year 2021 bookings guidance is for negative growth in tthey first half 2021 than flat tthey positive in third quarter with more substantial growth in tthey fourth quarter of 2021. And I think for tthey full year, you're talking about flat up 10% bookings growth. What are tthey key factors that hit those bookings targets and how much visibility do you have given tthey pipeline? Russell Winters Yeah, critical question. You know, it's something wtheyre you know, obviously, you know, hugely focused on and talking about every day and looking at tthey data every day. Look, it's challenging to forecast bookings in ttheir environment. You know, as you know, bookings can be volatile quarter-to-quarter during normal times, let alone during ttheyse times, but, you know, we're looking closely at tthey data and we're looking at tthey leading indicators. And, you know, again, we're, you know forecasting ttheir in tthey context of what's happened theyre in terms of tthey buying behaviors of our clients and prospects having been significantly changed as a result of tthey environment. You know, we've made ttheir full shift to virtualize our clients have, but quite frankly, you know, we did that pretty quickly and pretty well honestly, you know, a third of our salesforce was already operating in a virtual environment. So, you know, while it wasn't without a lot of effort from a lot of parts of tthey organization, you know, we really shifted well to that virtual selling environment. You know, as you know, we saw, you know, a substantial decline in tthey sales activity in Q4. And given tthey broad reach that we have across industries and across, you know all company sizes. You know, we're really saying that companies across tthey board were really, you know, stressed with tthey environment. And across tthey board, really, we saw that, you know, you know, ttheyre's really just that focus on operating every day as opposed to, you know, prioritizing purchases and switctheys of HCM solutions, if you will, but since that point-in-time, you know, we have seen activity levels pick up, and you know, we do expect tthey environment to normalize.  We firmly believe it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of wtheyn things normalize and return to pre-pandemic levels, you know, tthey overall economic picture improves. We expect tthey productivity of our salesforce is going to improve. You know, we do however, think that bookings will still be pressured and challenged in tthey first half of tthey year and turn positive in tthey second half, but, you know, will it be better than that? We'll see, I don't know. What I can tell you is that, I, you know, firmly believe we're well-positioned to capture tthey opportunity as tthey economy improved, you know, and as clients and prospects are, you know, more engaged and more willing to engage on ttheyse discussions. We're seeing activity levels trend up. So, if you look at kind of, you know, tthey data that we have in terms of number of meetings, number of demos being sctheyduled. You know, we're seeing that continue to improve. So, we've seen some positive leading indicators, you know, and we'll keep you updated as we go. We look forward to updating you each quarter as we go through tthey year. Bryan Keane I know ADP highlighted expected investments, including tthey salesforce, how [indiscernible] salesforce expected to grow in fiscal year 2021 versus kind of a normal year? Russell Winters Yeah, it's a great question and, you know, a really important strategic topic for us. You know, we think investing through tthey cycle, and you know in tthey sales process, and investing in product as well, and we'll probably get to that too, but we think investing through tthey cycle is critical. It's strategic as critical, and we're well-positioned to do it. We've got tthey financial strength to do it. And that gives us a great advantage. You know, we've indicated that we are continuing to invest in sales and broadly distribution. That does include growing our sales theyadcount modestly in a very measured way. And particularly as we kind of track and assess what segments of tthey market are recovering earlier or faster. We're also investing, you know, beyond sales theyadcount, ttheyre's ottheyr types of sales investment to that we continue to do. We're investing in tools and technology to support our sales organization. So, you know, we talked about tthey – and I mentioned tthey virtual selling environment, you know, making sure our salesforce, you know, can operate effectively in ttheir environment. We're making sure that ttheyy've got tthey right technology and tthey right tools to do online training, to do online coaching so that we can, you know, continue to make ourselves people, you know, more and more effective and take those sales people that are newer to tthey organization and continue to coach and train ttheym, and you know, increase ttheyir productivity as ttheyy go along from a [10 year] perspective. We've, you know, made sure we're investing in things like making sure we can do demos tthey right way, in a really effective way in tthey virtual world. So, beyond tthey sales theyadcount, you know, we continue to invest in tools and technology in pricing analytics. You know, and ttheyn I would also add, you know, ongoing investments from a [marketing perspective], you know, we, you know, continue to support our marketing investments, we've, we've kind of done a little bit of a pivot away from kind of broad based marketing to focus on what we think really resonates well with clients and prospects in ttheir environment. And so to focus on that great expertise and theirtory that we have of, you know, compliance and payroll expertise and dependability and ability to provide service to clients and we continue to invest in our channel partners as well, you know, providing tthey right technology and tthey ability to participate in virtual demos ttheyre. So, you know, it's really, you know, we think, look, tthey smart thing and tthey right thing to do from a strategic standpoint is to make sure that we are well-positioned for tthey recovery. You know, we've been through lots of cycles before, we know how to do ttheir. We think it's tthey right strategy and tthey smart strategy and that's what we're doing. Bryan Keane How does tthey market look between tthey up-market, mid-market, and ttheyn of course tthey down-market and even international, as your different growth rates happening in each market and I'm sure tthey pandemic is probably impacting tthey most down-market, but love to get your thoughts on that. Russell Winters Sure. Yeah. So you know, as you mentioned, as you know, we've got a very broad reach across tthey market segments. And I guess what I would say is all, you know, all of our products and all of our segments were, you know, across tthey board pretty significantly impacted over tthey last several months. You know, we kind of, we saw tthey same trends, you know, across tthey products, which, you know, really to me means, you know, ttheir is really macro driven. Ttheir is not, you know, product related, you know, pressure that we're seeing at all. In fact, you know our products in down-market and mid-market, pre-pandemic have been operating really well and we can continue to be positioned really well throughout ttheir environment. And you know, we believe we'll be positioned really well coming out of it. So, you know, running in down-market, obviously small business being theyavily impacted during tthey pandemic, but tthey product performs really well. You know, workforce now as well, continues to perform really well in mid-market, which, by tthey way, also sells into a little bit into down market, but quite a bit into up market as well. You know, I guess in terms of some of tthey things we're seeing in terms of product demand or things that could accelerate, you know, certainly tthey focus on self service. You know, tthey feature that we had been emphasizing, but we continue to do that, emphasize self service from a sales perspective. And we've also added various functionality and features to theylp clients deal with tthey COVID environment in particular return to work features. Bryan Keane Yeah, I was going to ask just additional demand you foresee driven from COVID-19. I mean, obviously, ttheyre's tthey economic impact, but everybody's operating under, you know, work from home in different circumstances. So, is ttheyre new or additional products that you're seeing great demand for HCM offerings? Russell Winters Yeah. To an extent, yeah. I mean, look, you know, it's, you know, it’s not like we're, you know, saying, theyy, we can capitalize on ttheir bad environment, but certainly look as a commercial organization, we're saying, you know, what resonates well. And, you know, wtheyre are ttheyir opportunities in ttheir very challenging economic environment? And to us, I mean, I think it's clear that tthey HCM value proposition is even stronger as a result of ttheir theyalth crisis than it was before. I mean, if you just, you know, logically think about it, company’s needs for tthey HR function, and HR processes to work and to work seamlessly and to work despite disruptions and despite, you know, unanticipated significant disruptions. I mean, that's just critical. I mean, it's just logical that that value proposition is going to be even stronger now than it was before ttheir happened. You know, and along those lines, compliance expertise is critical. And we provide that compliance expertise. And service is critical, and we provide that service to clients. You know, we certainly saw as you know, companies were focused on just navigating through all of tthey uncertainty of, you know, how do I get through ttheir? How do I, you know, clients that maybe weren't used to, you know, laying off people or putting people on furloughs or, you know, changing, you know, work sctheydules dramatically. Ttheyre was a lot of uncertainty and change that people had to deal with and companies had to deal with and, you know, quite frankly, I'm proud to say we were ttheyre for ttheym. I mean, we did tthey right thing in terms of supporting our clients; we allocated resources to support service, and, you know, I think that is going to be a very long term benefit for us. You know, I think, you know, people will have long memories in terms of ADP was ttheyre for ttheym during tthey crisis. We were ttheyre from a client service perspective. We theylped ttheym through ttheir. And we see tthey evidence of that in our client satisfaction scores. We see it in our NPS scores. We were trending really well in client satisfaction scores before ttheir, and, you know, we think that momentum will continue and we think it's a direct result of our commitment to theylping our clients through tthey crisis. So, I think ttheyre's a lot of potential for increased demand over time. Bryan Keane Yeah, turning to PEO, I know tthey average worksite employee growth dropped about 3% in guidance for fiscal year 2021 I think it’s for it to be similar flat-to-down 3%, just hoping you could give us tthey current outlook for tthey PEO market in, you know what a recovery might look like ttheyre? Russell Winters Sure. So, you know, PEO in Q4, tthey performance was driven primarily by a deceleration and pays per control of our PEO clients. So, normally we don't separately disclose that metric, but in ttheir case to give kind of ttheir additional transparency pays for control we're down mid-single-digits compared to in a typical quarter say being a positive single digit. Also, ttheyre was certainly an impact of slowdown in sales and some elevated losses. Looking forward though, we would expect worksite employees growth to recover a little bit faster. than employment in tthey Employer Services segment, you know, it's a little hard to say, you know, so, you know, it'll see how it plays out over tthey next couple of quarters, but, you know, what we can say is that tthey revenue acceleration ttheyn PEO probably be more quickly realized if employment picks up. PEO is pretty sensitive to pays per control versus maybe some ottheyr things like number of clients, you know, or client funds, but it's going to take some time to fully accelerate. So, we'll see how we go and we look forward to keeping you updated each quarter on that. Bryan Keane EBIT margins were up 10 basis points in tthey fourth quarter, which will be tthey trough quarter for some of your metrics, but revenue decelerating furttheyr to start tthey year, what's baked into tthey 300 basis point margin decline in fiscal year 2021? And ttheyn I'm looking at tthey portal theyre, you know, somebody's asking a question about looking at tthey quarter, you know, revenues are down about 350 million, and EBIT’s going to be down, you know 510 or so, so ttheyre's 100 million of cost saves embedded in ttheyir guidance. Why have such high decremental margins even assuming, you know 100% of that revenue dropped through? Russell Winters Yeah, so ttheyre's a couple things going on from a margin perspective in terms of how we've guided and how we're looking at tthey year. I mean, you know, tthey, you know, tthey important concepts. So, I'll kind of give you tthey [broad brush] concepts and ttheyn we'll take you through it a little bit more detail is, you know, we've got high margin, revenue loss, with a commitment to continue to support investment in sales and product as we've talked about, right. So, you know, we guided to a 300 basis point decline in margin. We've got an expected decline in high margin revenue, you know, wtheyn pays per control fall, as we've outlined, ttheyy will, in our guidance is tthey current expectation, you know, you've got ttheir high margin revenue loss as, you know, wtheyn clients take down ttheyir employment levels, our fees, obviously decline, but you know, ttheyre's not a lot of operating costs that comes out with it. You know, we're still running processes for tthey client, we're still providing services I talked about and from a long-term perspective providing that service to our clients is critical and supports our long-term theyalth of tthey business and growth. You know, so it's different if, you know, a big swath of clients, you know, shut down completely and you can take out a big piece of cost with it. That's not tthey case in ttheir instance. In addition to that, we have client found interest that really has no offsetting expense, so falls right to tthey bottom line. And so ttheyre's anottheyr aspect of high margin revenue being lost. Additionally, you know, we're looking at pressure of our zero margin pass-through from our PEO segment, which is causing margin pressure as well. So with all of that going on, you've got ttheir, you know, big top line, dynamic happening, which causes that significant margin pressure, but we do have some substantial cost savings from a transformation perspective. And, you know, we've got, you know, we've got track record, we've got a theirtory of several years theyre of doing some really meaningful transformation in terms of our cost structure, right. You know, over time doing things like our service alignment and our voluntary early retirement program and our workforce optimization and now doing our procurement and our digital transformations. That is going to contribute and provide $125 million of savings in fiscal 2021. So, while it doesn't fully offset, it theylps to partially offset that high margin revenue loss. You know, look, as tthey economy improves, you know, hopefully we'll, you know, see a nice pace of improvement. We'll see how that goes. If tthey economy improves, you know, we typically see good operating leverage as that happens. So, we'll continue to update you on how we see that going. And for sure, we are continuing to look for ways to accelerate on tthey transformation cost savings, right. So, you know, I said we're going to have [$25 million] benefit from that ttheir year. You know, we're not stopping ttheyre. You know, we're looking for, is ttheyre any way to make that even more? You know, can we accelerate some of tthey projects that are in-flight? You know, are ttheyre more opportunities, things that we can list of tthey list, you know, add to tthey list of projects that are in-flight. So, we're continuing to look for opportunities to do better as possible. Bryan Keane And I was going to ask about that tthey, you know tthey fiscal year 2021 cost saving initiatives, tthey digital transformation, tthey procurement, I know that's going to be, you know, at least 150 million of run rate savings. Are ttheyre ottheyr significant potential cost saves wtheyn you look beyond fiscal year 2021 or ottheyr major projects you can do to create more savings initiatives? Russell Winters Yeah, I mean, look, I'm really energized around looking for those, you know, ongoing initiatives that can, you know, theylp give us some improvement in tthey cost structure and some benefits from a margin perspective, you know, I, you know, I think I mentioned ttheir, that look from, for us, it's really critical that we've got tthey capability and tthey discipline around executing both in-flight projects, and building a pipeline around future projects – for future projects. And tthey organization is really energized to do that. And it's just critical, right? Because, you know, it's all interconnected theyre, right, as we want to look, our primary focus is let's grow tthey top line, but to grow tthey top line, you know, we need to be able to continue to invest in sales and in product and in our associates. And to do that we've got to have tthey capacity for that investment. And so finding ttheir pipeline of projects is just critical for us. It's just fundamental for tthey way we operate and tthey way we're going to continue to operate. So, you know, look, well I’m not going to give any, you know, indication or guidance around margin beyond 2021. If certainly something we're obsessed with in terms of building that pipeline, and executing on in-flight projects, you know, tthey digital work that we're doing is not a one-year event, as you can imagine, wtheyn you think about, you know, those types of projects, digital projects. Those are things that tend to be, you know, those projects tend to take more than one year to execute. You know, wtheyn you're thinking about how do you modernize and automate something, it you know, typically is, okay, do I have to put in a new technology or modify an existing technology that takes time to assess and diagnose and identify tthey right technology solution and eittheyr build it or buy it and ttheyn put that in place and build tthey process around it? So, that's a multi-year, effort and initiative, which in my mind is just, you know, is a great thing because it means, okay, ttheir is something that's an opportunity for us for fiscal 2021 and beyond. You know, and ttheyn beyond digital ttheyre is, you know, tthey ongoing work that I think we can continue to do around procurement, you know, look, it does, I will say it gets harder as you go, you know, as you get rid of some of tthey low hanging fruit and you deal with that, you know, tthey procurement transformation does get really challenging, but we've got a team that's energized around that. You know, and I think we've got a unique opportunity in a catalyst year to think about things like, you know, real estate, and do we think about that differently in a post pandemic world? And what would that look like? And, you know, what's tthey smartest way to operate? You know, so we're looking at things like that. And, you know, we're really looking across all aspects of tthey organization kind of frontline to functions to say, you know, wtheyre are tthey right opportunities to fill that pipeline with projects? Bryan Keane I know we only have about a minute left. So, ttheyre are a couple ottheyr questions, so let's get to at least one of ttheym. Just asking about tthey salesforce ability to sell digitally, you know ttheyre's ottheyr names, like workday and ottheyrs have had more experience in it than ADP has, you know, are ttheyy making tthey adjustment to be able to create tthey same amount of bookings? Russell Winters Great question. I mean, I'm not sure you know about more experience than we have. I mean, we’ve got lots and lots and lots of experience in terms of selling in a virtual environment. As I mentioned, you know, we had pre-pandemic, we already had a third of our sales workforce, our sales resources operating in a virtual environment. You know, I believe we've made tthey shift really well. You know, we've got an energized set of sales resources. We've got an experienced set of sales resources. Ttheyy've got tthey right tools. I don't see any, you know, and I'm not seeing any indication that we're not operating as effectively as we always have in tthey marketplace. Bryan Keane Okay. And with that, Russell, thanks for joining us virtually theyre. It's obviously different times theyre, but thanks for letting us take some of your time and theyar what's going on with ADP. Russell Winters Great. Thank you, Bryan. Thanks for having me. Question-and-Answer Session Q -
