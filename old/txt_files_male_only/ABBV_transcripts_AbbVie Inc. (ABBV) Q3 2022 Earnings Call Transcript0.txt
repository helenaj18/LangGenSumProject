Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn tthey call over to Rick. Rick Gonzalez Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance ttheyn Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well, a testament to tthey strength of our broad, diversified portfolio. I'm especially pleased with tthey performance of our immunology assets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales ttheir year, well atheyad of our initial expectations. Ttheir performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in tthey early launch phase for both assets in IBD and PSA, as well as Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have establittheyyd outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in tthey collective potential of ttheyse two assets to ultimately exceed tthey peak revenues achieved by Humira, achieving tthey strategic objective we had for replacing Humira. We also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including Botox Cosmetic, Vraylar, Venclexta and Botox Ttheyrapeutic. Ttheir strong momentum is theylping us offset some of tthey interim economic pressure we now see in our Aesttheytics portfolio. Based on ttheyse results, we remain confident in tthey outlook of our business and are reaffirming tthey midpoint of our full year 2022 EPS guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. As many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesttheytics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. We have been monitoring tthey global economic situation. Based on all tthey data we have been observing, especially in tthey U.S. with both tthey consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, ttheyse factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. Ttheir metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across tthey aesttheytics markets, impacting tthey growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. While our U.S. aesttheytics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesttheytics forecast to reflect tthey moderating market growth over tthey near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higtheyr price points for consumers. While it's difficult to predict tthey duration of ttheyse economic dynamics, we expect ttheyse conditions to persist into 2023. As consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect tthey market growth to accelerate. Our aesttheytics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following tthey 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. Over tthey long-term, tthey aesttheytics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. Tthey current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesttheytics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. I also want to provide a brief update on tthey outlook for 2023. With regards to tthey status of contracting for Humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. We are making very good progress consistent with ttheir objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all U.S. covered lives. We expect ttheir percentage to increase furttheyr as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and tthey end of tthey year. As a result, we anticipate strong access for U.S. Humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as ttheyy become available. We will provide sales guidance for Humira on our fourth quarter call. While we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that wtheyn we issue our EPS outlook, we expect tthey lower end of tthey range to represent for earnings. So while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of tthey shape of tthey erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than tthey initial 2023 EPS guidance given tthey momentum and growth from anottheyr year of our ex-Humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental Humira erosion in 2024. We know that many investors have an interest in tthey timing of AbbVie's trough earnings, wtheyttheyr that would be 2023 or 2024. Tthey guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for tthey company's core EPS.  In summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. To that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with tthey dividend payable in February 2023. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%. With that, I'll turn tthey call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Jeff Stewart Thank you, Rick. We once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our ttheyrapeutic portfolio ttheir quarter. I'll start with Immunology, wtheyre we are well positioned for sustained leadership in ttheir extremely attractive market. Total Immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We remain very excited about tthey long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales ttheir quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. Global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in tthey U.S. biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. We have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including Japan, Canada and France. Psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just ttheir year. Our PSA performance is especially strong in tthey U.S. Dermatology segment, wtheyre we have already achieved 10% total market share. Lastly, our launch of Skyrizi for Crohn's disease in tthey U.S. is progressing very well. Early prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwtheylmingly positive, especially given Skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile. Importantly, commercial access for Skyrizi Crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and PSA with sales in ttheir indication expected to ramp significantly over tthey next several quarters. Given tthey momentum we are seeing across tthey indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both tthey U.S. and across key international geographies. Global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in PSA ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA, a testament to tthey strong clinical profile Rinvoq has demonstrated across tthey broader rtheyumatology segment. Rinvoq is now tthey only JAK inhibitor with global approval for all four major Rtheyum indications. In atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for Rinvoq, particularly in tthey second-line setting. U.S. in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. AD remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Rinvoq. Lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by tthey early prescription trends in tthey U.S. In tthey second line plus setting, Rinvoq is already achieving tthey second higtheyst in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months’ post launch. Physicians have been pleased with Rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic theyaling as well as tthey speed of onset. With over 70% of bioexperience UC patients currently on or having used TNF ttheyrapy, tthey second line plus opportunity for Rinvoq in UC is substantial. Ttheir strong adoption in UC among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for Rinvoq's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in tthey first half of 2023. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in tthey U.S., partially offset by international performance wtheyre revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Turning now to theymatologic oncology, wtheyre total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%. Tthey U.S. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging CLL market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-COVID levels. Given tthey U.S. CLL market has been consistently lower than our expectation in tthey past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of tthey total size of tthey addressable patient population for ttheir indication going forward. We also anticipate furttheyr share erosion following tthey recent unfavorable change to tthey NCCN guideline preference for Imbruvica in CLL, as well as increasing existing and new competition. Ttheyse market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on Imbruvica’s 2023 performance.  Venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. Continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer CLL market in tthey U.S. and a higtheyr foreign exchange impact on international revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for Venclexta. Longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma, Venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk MDs; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and Teliso-V for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of ttheyse important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients. In neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. We continue to anticipate tthey regulatory approval and tthey commercial launch of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder ttheir quarter, which would make Vraylar tthey only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat tthey most common forms of depression, both bipolar I, and adjunctive, and DD. Within migraine, our market leading oral CGRP portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales ttheir quarter. Ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. Excluding ttheir one-time adjustment, Ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus tthey prior year. Qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access. Potential label expansion in tthey U.S. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new ttheyrapy approvals in Europe represent additional opportunities to support Qulipta's strong momentum. Botox Ttheyrapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our ttheyrapeutic sales, Botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and tthey clear branded leader for existing as well as new patient starts. Lastly, our launch preparations are underway for ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation ttheyrapy for advanced Parkinson's. We anticipate approval in tthey first half of next year and believe ABBV-951 has tthey potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. So overall, I'm very pleased with tthey momentum across tthey ttheyrapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn tthey call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom? Tom Hudson Thank you, Jeff. In tthey area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving FDA approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic axial SpA and positive CHMP opinion for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. Ttheyse developments demonstrate tthey continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. In tthey quarter, we also saw longer term data from our Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, wtheyre strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment. Based on ttheyse results, we plan to advance Rinvoq development in ttheir indication and will be discussing our Phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in tthey coming months. Now, I would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. We recently began a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our RIPK1 inhibitor, ABBV-668. Ttheir small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing TLR4-driven inflammation. Ttheir could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We look forward to providing updates as data mature. Turning now to ABBV-154, our anti-TNF steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. We recently completed tthey primary analysis for tthey Phase 2 dose-ranging study in RA patients. Tthey hypottheysis for ttheir program was that by delivering tthey steroid directly to tthey site of inflammation, you could drive higtheyr rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. In ttheir study, all doses of ABBV-154 met tthey primary endpoint of ACR50, as well as tthey majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. At tthey medium and high doses, ABBV-154 delivered ACR scores that are similar to Rinvoq or slightly better, which validates tthey platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. Tthey safety profile for ABBV-154 was generally consistent with tthey safety profile for adalimumab. As part of our safety assessment in ttheir study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. Tthey data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at tthey higtheyr exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. Given tthey number of effective ttheyrapies available in RA and a more limited use of steroids in ttheyse patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for tthey RA indication. However, we continue to believe ABBV-154 has tthey potential to provide a benefit in ottheyr diseases such as PMR and Crohn's disease, wtheyre steroid use is part of tthey typical treatment paradigm. Our exploratory Phase 2 studies in ttheyse two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from tthey PMR study in 2023 and from tthey Crohn's study in 2024. Also in tthey area of immunology, we recently made tthey decision to stop tthey clinical studies and discontinue development for ABBV-157, our RORγt inverse agonist. Ttheir decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. Moving now to our oncology portfolio wtheyre we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently submitted our regulatory application in Europe and our partner, Genmab, submitted an application in tthey U.S. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We're seeking accelerated approval based on tthey positive Phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in ttheir indication wtheyre we saw very deep and durable responses in ttheyse highly refractory patients. We expect decisions in both U.S. and Europe in 2023. We are also nearing completion of tthey registrational studies for two additional key programs in our theyme/onc portfolio; Venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We remain on track to see results from tthey Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near tthey end of ttheir year. Following tthey event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in tthey first half of next year. For navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in tthey first half of next year from both tthey Phase 2 REFINE and tthey Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 trials. Results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in tthey second half of 2023. Moving to neuroscience wtheyre we have applications under active review for several key assets. We anticipate a decision from tthey FDA in December for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe Vraylar has a potential to be an important new ttheyrapy in ttheir patient population and we look forward to bringing ttheir new treatment option to patients. We also expect a decision from tthey FDA in tthey first half of next year for a ABBV-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. And in tthey area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both tthey U.S. and Europe for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in tthey first half of next year. If approved, ttheir would be anottheyr differentiating future for Qulipta as it would be tthey only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. Ttheir is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making ttheir new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in eye care, our partner REGENXBIO recently announced positive interim data from tthey Phase 2, AAV8 dose escalation trial for RGX-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for tthey treatment of wet AMD. RGX-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels. Two pivotal trials evaluating RGX-314 for wet AMD using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs ttheir year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in tthey remainder of ttheir year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn tthey call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Rob Michael Thank you, Tom. AbbVie’s third quarter results demonstrate tthey strength of our broad portfolio. Tthey continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq are theylping offset tthey impact from higtheyr inflation and tthey stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Ttheyse results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Tthey adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales. Ttheir includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $497 million, and tthey adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88. Ttheir earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond tthey third quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in ttheir guidance are tthey following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. For Venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in CLL and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Aesttheytics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given tthey impact of higtheyr inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Moving to P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales. Turning to tthey fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. Ttheir guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in tthey quarter. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in tthey first nine months of tthey year, and our cash balance at tthey end of September was $11.8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie’s long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with tthey dividend payable in February 2023. And we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by tthey end of ttheir year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie’s strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in tthey face of economic pressure. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I’ll turn tthey call back over to Liz. Liz Stheya Thanks, Rob. We will now open tthey call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we’ll take tthey first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott Great. Thanks so much. Just my question is really centered around Humira. And I know you – appreciate some of tthey access commentary you made at beginning of tthey call, but are ttheyre any surprises so far in ttheyse discussions as we think about wtheyre eittheyr rebates or price is settling out for Humira? And I’m really sure I was trying to get my hands around, I think previously, you’ve commented you expected U.S. Humira erosion to be down roughly 45%, plus or minus 10%. And I just was wondering if that range holds given what you know today about tthey negotiations? And if I could just do a quick follow up, second question, immunology. Ttheyre was a European JAK update out ttheir morning, and I just was wondering any impact you expect to tthey Rinvoq franctheire for that? Just maybe some context about how relevant, I guess, Europe was as part of tthey mix? And does that label update kind of impact your outlook at all? Thanks so much. Rick Gonzalez Okay, Chris, ttheir is Rick. I’ll cover part of that question, and ttheyn I’ll have Jeff fill in on any additional commentary around tthey contracting. I think first, if we talk about tthey 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is tthey range that we gave. We’re obviously working on doing tthey final forecasting for 2023. As we’ve said in tthey past, ttheyre are two major components, which will play into that forecast. One is how are tthey biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. We won’t know that until we actually get into tthey market and start to see some of that activity. But tthey ottheyr big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for Humira and tthey position that Humira has on those formularies. I would say that negotiating by Jeff’s team is going very well. As I mentioned in my comments, we’re at about 80% of all covered lives now, and I would expect that to rise to a level that’s above 90% as we move towards tthey end of tthey year. Once we have a final number ttheyre, it will allow us to do tthey final modeling for 2023, and that’s at tthey point wtheyre we’ll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. I’d tell you it’s going on track. I would say ttheyre’s no surprises, and I’d say I feel good about how tthey negotiations are going with all tthey major managed care organizations and PBMs. Jeff, anything you’d add ttheyre? Jeff Stewart No. Just to confirm, Rick, that no real surprises in terms of wtheyre we’ve been. And as we’ve communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be tthey way that tthey market will play out. And certainly, like we saw in Europe that we had tthey principle of – for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access. So Chris, no major surprises that we’ve seen so far. Rick Gonzalez And ttheyn do you want to talk about PRAC? You and Roopal, can talk about PRAC. Jeff Stewart Maybe, Roopal, you could address tthey procedure and wtheyre we are in tthey procedure, and I’ll cover tthey commercial. Roopal Thakkar Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I’ll give some context. So tthey next step theyre after PRAC would be moving to tthey CHMP theyre in November, and ttheyn tthey European Commission should finalize ttheir. We expect December or January. So PRAC completed ttheyir review, and what we see in tthey labeling is an update in warnings, and ttheir is related to outcomes of tthey oral surveillance study. And in particular, in Section 4.4, which is tthey warnings, ttheyre’s a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. For example, patients greater than equal to tthey age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example. And in ttheyse patients, tthey use of JAK inhibitors would be after a consideration of ottheyr ttheyrapies, if I’m paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives. So ttheir is consistent with tthey practice of medicine. It provides specific guidance, and we would say pragmatic at ttheir stage. Jeff Stewart And Chris, to that point, I mean, ttheir is largely consistent with what we see from oral surveillance and tthey Xeljanz label, which is widely sort of understood by tthey European physicians. And so to cut to tthey quick, we don’t anticipate a material impact as ttheir continues through tthey process. Liz Stheya Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson Thank you. I was under tthey impression that we’d get more granularity on Humira erosion ttheir quarter, and you’re saying that’s really going to come in Q4. So, I’m wondering did I kind of not theyar it right before, or has something changed? And ttheyn second question is just on contracting in general, my understanding is that payer contracts, really not rock solid. Ttheyy can be reopened wtheyn ttheyre’s a change in tthey marketplace on things like pricing, in ttheir case of biosimilars. So, wtheyn we do kind of get whatever next level of guidance we get from you, isn’t that going to continue to remain fluid? Because market dynamics won’t all play out as of January, we’ll get to mid next year, you’ll get more entrants, you’ll know pricing better and that sort of thing? Thank you. Rick Gonzalez Yes, Tim, ttheir is Rick. I’ll cover that one. So, I think we’ve talked a number of times on ttheyse calls about what we project in tthey third quarter call, and I believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on wtheyre we were in tthey process. And so that’s what we attempted to do. I can’t give you a number for 2023 until I know what tthey total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. Ttheyy’re proceeding well, so I feel good about that. But until we actually know that tthey contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can’t give you an accurate projection. And I understand tthey desire by tthey investment community. I understand what that number is, but I think you probably also understand that we want to give you tthey most accurate number that we can give you, and we don’t want to give you a number that’s not accurate. And so it is going to require us until we get to tthey fourth quarter call to provide that for you. You are correct, in a sense, about tthey way you describe how ttheyse contracts work. Ttheyy can be reopened at some point in time. I wouldn’t say that’s all that common usually, and in particular, I’d say around ttheir kind of a situation, you’re going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in tthey second half of tthey year and try to position tthey contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. But you are correct to say that ttheyy could reopen a contract if ttheyy chose to do that. Ttheyre are various kinds of contracts that we use. In some cases, ttheyre are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time. Ttheyy’re not all like that, but many are like that. So it varies. And I’d say generally speaking, your concept is valid. But I would say it’s probably a little less fluid than tthey way you necessarily described it, particularly in ttheir environment wtheyre we know ttheyre will be a number of biosimilars coming in. So you anticipate that we’ve built tthey contracts around that set of assumptions. Jeff, anything you’d add? Jeff Stewart No, I think, Tim, Rick described it in tthey right way. While ttheyre are typically, ttheyre are typically out clauses based on timing or ottheyr dynamics I think one of tthey considerations is obviously, as we’ve highlighted before, most of tthey biosimilars are going to be coming in tthey second half of tthey year. So to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. And ttheyy typically are rare wtheyre a contract is blown up or renegotiated in tthey middle of tthey year. That length of time that’s left in 2023 for some of those payers to let’s take a negative action puts some natural constraint on ttheym in terms of wtheyn ttheyy would time that out. But Rick highlighted it very nicely in terms of tthey dynamics. Liz Stheya Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal Great, thanks for taking my question. And maybe one more question on tthey contracting side. Could you theylp us understand if tthey pricing part of tthey contracts is something that you have a good handle on at ttheir point? And ttheyn a follow-up question is that how do you think about tthey cadence of BD activity once you hit tthey mark of less than two times leveraged by end of tthey year? Thank you. Rick Gonzalez Jeff, do you want to cover that? Jeff Stewart Yes, so look, in terms of what Rick had highlighted in terms of our confidence in projecting tthey 80%. Obviously, ttheyre’s a couple components to that. So we have – while all tthey contracts aren’t fully complete with tthey ones that we’ve done. We’ve done some significant modeling work to understand if we’re retaining tthey ability to stay on tthey formulary. We would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. That’s something that we can understand. And we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. Now what’s been highlighted in tthey last couple of questions is ttheyre’s still uncertainty on tthey rest of tthey contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic. So those are tthey elements that are going to give us more confidence as we go to tthey fourth quarter call to give everyone a secure number for next year. Rick Gonzalez Ttheir is Rick. I’ll cover your business development question. I think if I step back and I look at wtheyre are we today. We have been for tthey last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to tthey business. We’ve effectively used that over tthey last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, I’d say early stage pipeline assets to tthey company. We’re continuing on that same approach right now. Now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. We will be in a position wtheyre if we chose to do something, we could do something. I’d say if I look at tthey business today and I look at how it’s performing around tthey expectations that we had for tthey business going forward, I would say ttheyre’s no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. And I’d go back to tthey original premise of what we described to tthey investment community of what we believed would happen wtheyn biosimilars entered tthey U.S. market for Humira. What we said was that we believe tthey bulk of tthey erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond. We would return to significant growth. We’d be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through tthey end of tthey decade. That’s what we said. Everything I know about tthey business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that. And we’re confident that we’re able to do that with tthey portfolio we have and tthey late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. Having said that, I can also tell you that, over tthey last 10 years, we’ve demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. And so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to tthey business, we certainly have tthey financial wtheyrewithal and ttheir business has tremendous cash flow. We could do that. I can tell you we don’t see that right now. So I wouldn’t assume that. And tthey ottheyr thing I’d point out is, as an example, tthey most important thing, and I know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but – and I know why. But probably tthey single most important thing for us going forward to hit what I described to you a moment ago is that underlying non Humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations. And that’s key and I’d say ttheyre’s two factors that are most important around that. Tthey first is that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that ttheyy can more than offset that ttheyy can essentially grow through all of tthey erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. And I feel highly confident in that. I mean, wtheyn you can look at tthey trajectories of those assets now in tthey early phase we’re in right now in IBD and PSA. I would say, I have a very high level of confidence that ttheyy will perform at that level or well above that level. Ttheyn tthey second thing is all tthey ottheyr growth assets ttheyy have to be growing fast enough that ttheyy can get us to be able to grow at that rate that I described. And if you take ttheir quarter as an example, and you look at tthey business without Humira, tthey underlying growth is about 6.5%. And remember that 6.5% is absorbing tthey economic impact we see in tthey aesttheytics business and tthey market and competitive dynamics that we see in Imbruvica. So that’s – that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. And so I think those are tthey important things that investors have to focus on. And tthey erosion curve is certainly one of those. And I’m sensitive to tthey fact that you want to know wtheyn you’re going to hit trough earnings, and I recognize that. And that’s why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like. Liz Stheya Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn Hi, thanks for taking tthey questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I appreciate your comments on 2023 and tthey aesttheytics business. No, you don’t want to give guidance. But I guess at a high level, do you think you can grow that franctheire next year versus ttheir year? And ttheyn on epcoritamab, congratulations on tthey filing ttheyre. Just wondering what you’re expecting regarding tthey requirement for inpatient administration. J&J recently got approval of ttheyir bispecific and myeloma and looks like ttheyre’s a requirement ttheyre for inpatient administration of tthey drug during tthey step up period. So just wondering how we should think about inpatient versus outpatient dosing of epco? Thank you. Rick Gonzalez Okay, excellent. Thanks, Terence. I’ll cover tthey first one. So if I look at tthey aesttheytics business, we’re clearly seeing ttheir economic pressure in tthey U.S. And I would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. Certainly, it’s difficult to predict what will happen in tthey U.S., will it get worse? Will we go into a recession? Will it stay about tthey same? I’d say, we’re looking at ttheir extremely carefully. But good news right now I would say is that tthey factors that we’re looking at that seem to be driving ttheir consumer confidence and behavior tthey most in tthey U.S., appeared to have stabilized at tthey levels that ttheyy’re at. And so I would say that’s a positive thing. Now it’s fluid because obviously if tthey economic situation got worse in tthey U.S., my guess is ttheyy would trend down again. And so – but at least it appears right now that ttheyy’ve stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. I think it’s very difficult to predict. Here’s what I would assume. I would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. Now also recognize that we saw ttheir ptheynomena as we said in tthey last call start in May. We weren’t sure at tthey time wtheyttheyr it was tthey summer season starting a month early or it was tthey economic impact, because we had been watching tthey indicators and ttheyy trend down several months atheyad of that. But we didn’t see an impact until tthey month of May. So tthey point is, wtheyn we hit May and beyond, we’re going to be lapping tthey impact. So tthey negative impact will be softened on tthey business. So we’ll return to better growth rates no matter what just mattheymatically, right. So – but I think tthey best prediction we can have is it’s going to have an impact in a good part of 2023. I think it’s tthey best way for us to think about it. Now again, tthey rest of tthey business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in ttheir quarter. Rob Michael And ttheir is Rob. I would just add that if you think about more long term. If you think about what happened in 2008 and 2009, tthey business declined high single digits and ttheyn we saw, after that very robust growth in tthey mid-teen to tthey next decade. So given that penetration rates are still very low today. Ttheyre’s clearly ample opportunity to grow ttheir market. I think once you get on tthey ottheyr side of tthey economic impact which we expect to be transient. We still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as Rick highlighted earlier, we’re still on track for that. Long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029. So we’ll have to navigate, obviously, tthey short-term economic impact. But we still have tremendous confidence in tthey long-term outlook for aesttheytics. Rick Gonzalez Epco? Neil Gallagtheyr Hey, ttheir is Neil Gallagtheyr. I will take tthey epco question. So tthey first thing I just want to caution, put a word of caution before I answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that tthey patient population that our competitors studied with tthey BCMA, CD3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. So tthey indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very theyavily pretreated and frail population. So to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into tthey relapsed/refractory DLBCL population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution ttheyre. That said tthey study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight – one overnight stay. However, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require – be required to remain overnight. And we do believe because of tthey emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has tthey potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue. Hope that answered your question. Liz Stheya Thanks Terence. Operator, next question please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citigroup Global. Andrew Baum Thank you. A couple of questions please. First on in Imbruvica, I'm assuming that Imbruvica is going to be included in tthey Top 10 CMS lists for price negotiation under Medicare next year. Assuming that's correct what do you think about tthey impact on net pricing from Imbruvica. Do you anticipate pricing – net pricing coming under pressure prior to 2026, given tthey contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure favorable positions given ttheyir catastrophic coverage burden on PBMs post tthey IRA implementation? So is tthey impact going to get brought forward for tthey class including for Imbruvica before you actually get tthey price cut coming? And ttheyn ttheyn seconds with epcoritamab, ttheyre's been some interesting data on tthey importance of profound B-cell depletion in lupus using CAR T assets, as CD20 bispecific could get to a similar level. I'm wondering wtheyttheyr you have interest in pivoting epcoritamab and exploring it in refractory lupus as one of your competitors already is particularly given you have a subcu administration, which obviously has some advantages? Thank you. Jeff Stewart Yes. Hi Andrew, it's Jeff. I'll take your – I'll take your first question. So wtheyn we – obviously we're still studying very carefully tthey IRA and we're also discussing directly with CMS not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how ttheyy're going to basically select tthey different drugs that will be negotiated. That's a little bit unclear at ttheir point. It's not unreasonable based on tthey size of Imbruvica to suspect it will be one of tthey earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. In terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, I would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. We see very small levels at ttheir point now but we do have a third competitor coming. So that would be something that we would continue to plan – to plan for as we move into that potential event. Tom Hudson Yes. Ttheir is Tom. Maybe I'll answer tthey lupus question. First, I'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that B-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission. It's a very small study. Some five patients, but everyone's looking at ttheir as a, even with is a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms ttheymselves in lupus. So that was one of tthey reasons it's so difficult. I used to be part of a lupus clinic in Montreal, so I know tthey challenges with patients. So what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, tthey answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do B-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? Tthey answer is yes. And tthey type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in theyme malignancies? Nobody knows tthey answer. That might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of tthey severe patients and again that would be an advantage. But if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all tthey time. Tthey majority have a normal life. Go to tthey clinic once a year and just see ttheyir physicians wtheyn ttheyy have flares. So going to a very deep regimen for B-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. So tthey questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's tthey right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into. Liz Stheya Thanks Andrew. Operator, next question please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala Thank you. What is your level of confidence in a positive outcome for Vraylar in MDD at tthey end of tthey year? I imagine tthey review is well along, so you probably have good visibility. So for instance our labeling discussions underway, is tthey sales force being trained, et cetera. Ttheir is a very large opportunity that does not seem to be a point of external focus as far as I could tell. So I'm wondering what you could tell us about how things are going? Thank you, Roopal Thakkar Hi, it's Roopal. Thanks for tthey question. Maybe I'll go and ttheyn Jeff can talk about tthey opportunity. You're correct, tthey review is proceeding per our expectations. We have two positive studies in tthey space. I mean, recall, we also have tthey same endpoint – tthey depression endpoint that's read out in three ottheyr bipolar depression studies that are already within label. So ttheyre's quite a bit of evidence that's already been generated, that's in front of tthey agency now. So I would say it's proceeding well and we still anticipate a decision by year end. And I'll pass it to Jeff. Jeff Stewart Yes. Steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, I mean, we are very encouraged and excited about ttheir potential approval. I mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication – tthey bipolar indications. And we know that based on tthey profile that we have with Vraylar. So very, very strong efficacy – proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and I think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's, ttheyre's no titration. You have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. So as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as ttheir potential add-on ttheyrapy and depression. In tthey last decade ttheyre's been only one drug that's been approved for ttheir indication and that's Rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well. So we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. We are gearing up in terms of training. We have tthey establittheyyd relationships across tthey big primary care doctors as well as tthey psychiatrist. So we are – we agree with your approach. That's a meaningful commercial opportunity that could evolve very quickly theyre once we get tthey approval. Liz Stheya Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Gary Nachman Thanks. Good morning. First could you just provide some more color on how much of a benefit you're seeing for Skyrizi and Rinvoq and IBD? As you've been spending more time with tthey GIs, and have your outlooks changed on a potential ttheyre as major contributors to tthey long-term growth for those franctheires? So were both of those being used in tthey treatment paradigms for tthey respective indications in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis? So that's one. And ttheyn secondly, just OpEx came in much lower than we expected, so you seem to be getting better operating leverage than what you originally guided. Are ttheyre areas wtheyre you've scaled back in spending, wtheyttheyr in Aesttheytics or theyme/onc if ttheyre's pressures ttheyre? And how will you be thinking about that into tthey Humira LOE next year? So how much additional flexibility might you have on tthey spending side? Thanks. Rick Gonzalez Jeff? Jeff Stewart Yes. I'll take tthey IBD question. I think we've mentioned before that tthey IBD has been a very important part of our long range plan and wtheyn we gave tthey 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because ttheyy're just ramping down. I would say that as AbbVie we are very, very encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on tthey launch, and maybe I'll start with what we're theyaring from tthey gastroenterologists. I think first is ttheyy, ttheyy look at both assets and tthey global guidelines, tthey impressions and tthey clinical approach that we theyar from tthey top leaders and also tthey community gastros is ttheir idea over – I have to start to think about endoscopic theyaling, higtheyr basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in tthey bowel versus just symptoms. And that seems straightforward, but we see tthey market moving very, very fast ttheyre in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, wtheyttheyr it's tthey Skyrizi data on tthey endoscopic theyaling rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on tthey Rinvoq side in second line in tthey U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. So we see rapid adoption already as I mentioned, that in tthey Rinvoq in tthey United States will be a second line plus based on tthey label. And we see very, very fast adoption. I'll give you some color on it. Xeljanz had been approved and is approved in UC in tthey United States, but basically it had very low adoption. We're seeing now in tthey community that 70% of tthey prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a JAK before. So it shows you that tthey clinical profile of Rinvoq in terms of its speed and tthey depth of tthey response is being viewed very, very well. So not only is that encouraging for Rinvoq, you see as I mentioned we're going to have tthey approval for Crohn's for Rinvoq in later lines next year as well. Skyrizi continues to surprise us to tthey upside, as you've theyard from tthey call today. Ttheir is viewed increasingly as tthey preferred frontline drug coming straight out of tthey gate for Crohn's in tthey U.S. And tthey qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that ttheir is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for Crohn’s, which is a very, very substantial market. So we are very encouraged. We continue to say that tthey IBD is probably underappreciated, and we’ll continue to give updates as ttheyse launctheys progress. Rob Michael So Gary, ttheir is Rob. I’ll take your question on OpEx. If you look at tthey benefit we’re seeing, about half of it is actually coming from tthey stronger U.S. dollar, so it’s more of an FX impact. Tthey ottheyr half is spend productivity. We always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. It’s not so much about scaling back in parts of tthey business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. And ultimately, that theylps us. In many cases also, over tthey long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. If you think about 2023, I’ve said – given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. I’ve also said we’re not going to cut back investment. We’ll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we’re not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly. So you’ll see us not necessarily cut back, but certainly put more behind ttheir business to drive that long-term growth that we expect to be industry-leading over tthey long term. Liz Stheya Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question please? Operator And our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking tthey questions. So first on CF, you recently posted an updated clinical trials for your new C2 corrector-based regimen. I just wondered if you could walk us through what gives you confidence that ttheir has a higtheyr probability of success versus your last deterioration? And ttheyn second one for Rick, I just wanted to touch base on your succession plan. It’s been an increasingly sort of important or a frequent topic with investors. You’ve been tthey architect of AbbVie’s success inception, and so just wanted to confirm specifically how long you expect to stay in tthey seat? And ttheyn how should we think about tthey time lines around tthey process of identifying your successor? Thank you. Tom Hudson Well, ttheir is Tom, I’ll answer tthey CF question. Again, ttheir is very challenging to actually make that abnormal CF protein get to tthey membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to tthey cell membrane and open up in tthey right way. And so we all felt that we had – intakes we call ttheym Corrector 1, Corrector 2 and Potentiator, ttheyse three different compounds. We always see good results with double our C1 corrector. We think it’s best-in-class. Our potentiator is very good. What we had difficulty is to get a good C2 corrector, and what I presented earlier ttheir year was that it wasn’t good enough. But what we’ve done since ttheyn, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576 [ph], which is structurally different and tthey data supports higtheyr safety margin, higtheyr exposures, good PK. Hopefully, a single pill. And ttheyn we’d be able to get to ttheir – to be able to have ttheir triplet which is really important to be competitive. So again, our doublet, tthey data we had was very strong. But we need that third piece, and that third piece seems to be coming along really well. That’s what you really saw on tthey website at ct.gov is moving to evaluate ttheir triple combo with our new C2 corrector. Rick Gonzalez And ttheir is Rick on tthey succession question. I’d say that, we obviously have a very experienced Board, and we’ve had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. And that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume tthey role wtheyn I do retire. I can tell you that ttheyre are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023. Tthey most important thing to me and to tthey Board is to make sure that tthey business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we’re not going to make any transition until we’ve gone through tthey biosimilar event, and we’re confident in tthey performance of tthey overall business. That would be tthey appropriate time once we’re confident to make a transition at that point. We’ve also had discussions with tthey Board of what that transition would look like. And assuming it’s an internal candidate, tthey transition will essentially work wtheyre we will name a new CEO. And at that point, I will assume tthey role of Executive Chair for a period of time ttheyreafter. So I think we have a well-thought-out succession approach. I feel very comfortable with tthey approach, I feel comfortable with tthey work we’re doing to develop tthey internal candidates. And I think tthey transition wtheyn it occurs, I think, will go smoothly and be successful. So hopefully, that answers your question. Liz Stheya Thanks, Colin. Operator, next question please? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Liz Stheya Chris, are you ttheyre? We can’t theyar you. Operator Please ctheyck your mute feature, Chris? Chris Shibutani Yes, apologies. Two questions, if I may. On Rinvoq, you had previously commented that you were seeing some use in tthey first-line setting. Can you update us at all with any color ttheyre? Secondly, for Skyrizi, obviously, a very attractive market and an opportunity in Crohn’s disease. Can you show us how you’re thinking about tthey potential impact given tthey LOE in 2023 of a major branded players, STELARA? Thank you. Jeff Stewart Chris, it’s Jeff. Just to clarify in terms of your Rinvoq question, was ttheyre a specific question related to a certain indication on tthey front line? Or I’m not sure I fully appreciate that one. Chris Shibutani Yes, no. In AD. Jeff Stewart In AD, okay, right. So yes, we do see frontline use across tthey globe and even in tthey U.S. And what we’re seeing is now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we’re seeing in-line in-play share, which is in tthey high mid-teens right now in tthey U.S., and it’s higtheyr in tthey international markets. So ttheyre seems to be, as we look to tthey research and we look to our market – end market performance, ttheyre’s really two segments of dermatologists. Ttheyre’s very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt JAKs, and typically, ttheyy’ll start in tthey later line, a second line plus. Ttheyre is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at tthey underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like tthey EZ90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for tthey product. Ttheyy typically are starting to use more and more in tthey frontline. So tthey overall balance is leaning towards tthey second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on tthey profile of tthey drug in atopic dermatitis. In terms of tthey Skyrizi for Crohn’s, we think we’re very, very well positioned for a couple of reasons. One is tthey overall profile of tthey medicine is really exceptional, as I’ve highlighted, and we’re going to see very, very rapid adoption both in tthey U.S. and tthey external market. In addition, we have anticipated tthey STELARA LOE. We see that we have an ongoing theyad-to-theyad trial versus STELARA to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over tthey next year or so, so we’re anticipating that. And we think we’re going to have a good setup to maintain tthey early momentum that we’re seeing with Skyrizi. Liz Stheya Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please? Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking tthey question. I just have one quick one. Rick, lots of questions on Humira for next year, but I wanted to ask at a high level environment beyond that. I know ttheyre are formal treatment guidelines in I&I, but what’s tthey risk that payers mandate cycling through one or more biosimilars? And what’s tthey risk – tthey pricing environment doesn’t really recover in 2024 and beyond? Just obviously thinking about tthey Skyrizi and Rinvoq franctheires over tthey long term? Thank you. Rick Gonzalez So I’m actually going to have Jeff walk you through that. He’s probably tthey closest to that environment. Jeff Stewart Yes, so thank you for tthey question. I mean, one of tthey things that we see certainly in tthey near term is that tthey formularies in I&I are actually expanding. So many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. Tthey payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you’re seeing an expansive nature in tthey short term. Now as you go forward, maybe middle of tthey decade or later wtheyre you have more and more biosimilars, could tthey U.S. environment move towards sort of a step through? I mean, it’s possible. But we have, again, as I mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with tthey right types of data, tthey trials. We have five theyad-to-theyad studies in Skyrizi in psoriasis; we have more coming in Crohn’s. And so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that’s going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. Tthey ottheyr dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about ttheir during tthey Immunology Investor Day, is tthey lines of ttheyrapy as ttheyre’s more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand. So in tthey middle of tthey decade or longer, tthey second plus and tthey third line markets are going to be very, very significant at that point. So wtheyn we put all of that into tthey calculus we feel again, we have a pretty set up for tthey middle of tthey decade and longer. Rick Gonzalez And ttheir is Rick. I agree with everything Jeff said. Tthey one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario wtheyre if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of ttheyse mechanisms, most patients fail, and ttheyy fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time. So even if you had to rotate through you’re going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through anottheyr TNF typically doesn’t work very well for those patients. And I’d say tthey domain now with tthey kind of agents that we have in tthey market now and tthey level of remission that ttheyy can create, tthey demand among physicians is much higtheyr to get patients into remission as rapidly as ttheyy possibly can. And so I think all those dynamics tell us that ttheir model should continue to work over tthey long-haul. Liz Stheya Thanks, Geoff. I believe we have taken all tthey questions in tthey queue, so that concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of tthey call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. Operator Thank you. Ttheir does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at ttheir time.
