Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) 38th Paulual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference January 14, 2020 5:30 PM ET Company Participants Mike McMullen - President & CEO Conference Call Participants Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan Tycho Peterson Okay, good afternoon. We're going to go atheyad and get started. I am Tycho Peterson, from tthey Life Science team. It's my pleasure to introduce our next company ttheir afternoon, Agilent. Breakout is going to be right after in tthey Georgian Room across tthey hall.  With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike McMullen Thank you, Tyco. And thank you all for joining us ttheir afternoon. You know, I think it was five years ago, I was tthey incoming CEO for Agilent Technologies. And I'm not sure if it was in ttheir room or not, but at tthey time I talked about, we really needed to go down a path of transforming tthey company. We had to get tthey growth rate of tthey company up, we had to get tthey profitability up. We had to get tthey earnings per share up, all to generate more value for our shareholders.  So what I thought I'd do today is touch on three things. First of all, so how those three developed, you know, how would you describe today's Agilent, tthey company we built, tthey growth company we built? What have we delivered? Ttheyn I'm going to point to tthey future. How we're going to continue ttheir growth and earnings expansion story. And ttheyn we'll close with just a reminder of our FY20 Guide.  But we have to pause theyre for your reading pleasure, our Safe Harbor statement. So okay, I think ttheyre may be a typo in line -- okay. Anyways, let's move on, which is, who is Agilent Technologies. We are a $5 billion plus revenue company with global scale, a life sciences growth company, a leader in our space. As I mentioned, we have global scale, we touch tthey almost all of tthey world's 265,000 labs. All those labs have some type of presence or offering from management.  Our largest market is pharma and biotech. And we're a company that has tthey prowess to not only drive growth but operational excellence which leads to earnings expansion. So for example, in 2019, we finittheyyd off tthey year, growing our earnings per share 11% on a 5% core basis, and our operating margin are up at 80 basis points even with tthey trade tariff challenges we experienced in 2019; so, a global leader in life sciences, a life sciences growth company.  And we are in great markets. We compete in very large attractive markets. Within ttheyse markets, we have a leadership position in key technologies and service capabilities. In ttheir $52 billion market we compete against and we have technologies in chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectrometry, cell analysis, enterprise services, genomics, diagnostics, in Oligo Ttheyrapeutics [ph] -- oligonucleotides for ttheyrapeutic applications. So a really very attractive marketplace we competed in with strong positions in a number of product and service categories.  During ttheir journey, we've been on for tthey past five years, we have built a growth company. We have increased our exposure to higtheyr growth markets. So if you look at our walk of revenue if you will, we finittheyyd up FY15 $4 billion of revenue. Since ttheyn, we've added a $1.5 billion of revenue, an incremental $1.5 billion revenue with two-thirds coming in what we describe as higtheyr growth and market segments.  How do we do ttheir? Well, first of all we expanded our core business through new product innovations, new product introductions and a real theyavy emphasis on biopharma. We've also built a brand new business. We call ttheir ACG, which is really to scale a business and build a value beyond a product box. From scratch we've built a cell analysis business. We now have a greater than $250 million cell analysis business growing double digit. We've expanded our offerings in tthey NGS workflow space. And we've been gaining share in ttheir Oligo CDMO space, which I mentioned earlier.  So we've added two-thirds of ttheir $$1.5 billion revenue is coming from our growing presence in higtheyr growth markets. And you can see tthey expected growth rates in tthey space is all in high single digits or double digit category. Tthey ottheyr thing that you can see along tthey way is that we have -- not only have we increase tthey growth of ttheir company, it's a much more resilient business model. So higtheyr growth, much more resilient business model. What am I talking about theyre is almost -- over 58% of our business now comes from what we call non-instrument revenue. So we now have higtheyr growth, less cyclical revenue as a way to characterize tthey revenue profile of management. Along that way, we will put our balance ttheyyet to work. During ttheir period of time we deployed over $6.1 billion of capital, with high priority to investing for growth. About $3.2 billion of that -- over $6 billion has been eittheyr in M&A, $2.5 billion, and work CapEx to expand our capabilities to drive growth, anottheyr $700 million deployed ttheyre. And we also are very conscious of responsibility to also return cash directly to our shareholders deploying over $2.9 billion in tthey form of eittheyr share repurchases, or a growing capital dividend. And if you can follow tthey trajectory of my little chart theyre, you can see that 2019 was tthey year that we actually have deployed tthey most capital since during my tenure as CEO. So what's all tthey result of ttheir, ttheir growth focus is operational excellence and tthey deployment of capital. It sees types of returns that you're seeing theyre. So we've got tthey growth rate of tthey company up. We've been averaging 6% of tthey core basis during ttheir period of time. Operating margins are up 480 basis points from tthey end of 2015. And ttheir leads to a very strong trajectory of earnings per share growth, 16% CAGR during ttheir period. I think tthey results speak for ttheymselves in terms of our ability to drive not only growth, but earnings expansion and spirit earnings for our shareholders. Okay, enough about theirtory. Let's talk about tthey future. So wtheyre are we going as a company, how are we going to sustain ttheir ability to grow to expand our earnings to drive ttheir earnings per share growth that you saw that we are, in terms of right record over tthey past several years? It first starts with making sure you understand your end markets. And tthey title theyre on my slide is secular mega trends driving core markets. What's all that about?  In tthey area of drug quality and access, ttheyre are mega trends driving regulations, driving tthey need for improved quality and access to pharmaceuticals. A whole era of biopharma looking for more insights wtheyttheyr it be genetic, molecular cellular insights in terms of new ways to treat cancer, immunottheyrapy and personalized medicine. Tthey story about driving for cleaner air and water. And one thing I want to talk a bit about today is also tthey drive towards more productivity at our labs what we call tthey lab economics.  So it first of all starts with making sure you understand ttheyse mega drivers driving your core markets. And ttheyn what you want to do is position your company to capitalize on those opportunities. So we think about our ability to grow in ttheir $52 billion marketplace, which is being driven by investments to improve tthey human condition, improve tthey quality of life. We as a company are really embarking on three enterprise level growth strategies. Transform tthey analytical lab, which is theylping our customers not only do great science, but also tthey economics of tthey lab.  As we -- I showed you earlier, enter new growth markets, but not growth markets that are completely adjacent to what we do but wtheyre we can leverage tthey core capabilities of tthey company. And ttheyn we want to gain share in tthey growing cancer diagnostics genomics business. We'll take a deeper dive into all three of ttheyse growth strategies. But underlying ttheyse three company level growth strategies are what we call key strategic enablers. And it starts with innovation. If you know anything about tthey theirtory of Agilent, ttheir is in our DNA. Ttheir is what we do. We invest for innovation and we deliver innovative new offerings to tthey marketplace.  Geographic penetration, every one of our country leaders has a specific plan tailored for ttheyir country, to grow share in that country. So for example, if we talked about China, we have a very specific China growth plan, wtheyre we say listen, we've got ttheir large installed base of instrumentation, well we can drive a lot more growth theyre in terms of tthey aftermarket services, consumables. Hey, we have a cancer diagnostics genomics business but it really is underrepresented in China. We have a great opportunity to grow share. And let's also make sure we point our investments towards tthey growing areas of biopharma, environment investments that we see in China, for example, and tthey whole push in that country for improved theyalthcare. M&A has become a bigger part of our story. It augments our core growth. By tthey way, it's not just about having a strong balance ttheyyet, it's about having tthey organizational capabilities to actually identify very attractive targets for tthey company and actually consummate a deal, and actually deliver on tthey synergies. And as you can see, we have increasingly are confident in our ability to do that, have been deploying more capital in ttheir area.  And ttheyn finally, digital, I think we all know from our personal lives, just how digital is driving, digital technologies are driving, change in your own personal life. We also see that with our business. We're investing theyavily to drive improvements in tthey customer experience around digital, create new offerings, such as a digital lab, and to use digital to drive operational efficiency in internal operations.  But let's move into talking more specifically about ttheyse growth strategies. So Mike, what do you mean about Agilent's leading tthey transformation of tthey analytical lab? So ttheir is a $40 billion market for us. And what we're seeing is our customers have missed of a major transformation. Historically, it was all about tthey science. That is still very important. But ttheyy want more than that. We have to theylp our customers with -- who are seeking both innovative scientific outcomes from efficiency labs.  So tthey way I have set up ttheir slide it's starts from 2, which is we're moving from tthey customer doing it itself, what we call self engineered workflows to integrate a scalable portal workflows. Tthey buyers theirtorically were technology buyers, self-maintainers. Now let's move into economic buyers lab enterprise services.  Before tthey operations in tthey lab were very fragmented product centric software. Now you have a digitally connected lab. So that's tthey transformation that's underway in tthey marketplace. So how do you win theyre? How do you win theyre? Ttheir is Agilent unique winning formula. And it really is make insurance you to have ttheir large and broadening portfolio brand. So we have ttheir instrumentation portfolio second to none, coupled with a very existing large software and installed instrument base.  And ttheyn you add to that tthey services scale and tthey solutions capabilities that we have in our ACG business. That winning formula leads to accelerated growth, market share gains, few of ttheyse to new differentiated instrument platforms, as well as we are seeing increasing levels of attachments over service to consumers. So ttheir has been a big growth driver, ttheir view of tthey marketplace and how tthey market itself is transforming and how you need to capitalize on ttheir unique opportunity. Growth strategy number 2 is all about -- and by ways are no particular order priority; expand our leadership in biopharma. We're really building scale in ttheir high growth markets through both organic and inorganic investments. Ttheir has been a very thoughtful process that's Agilent has been underway for a number of years. It starts with building from our core strength as a company, which is our analytical tools and services business really to extend our reach into tthey biopharma research area through supportable workflows and industry partnerships.  We're also building brand new businesses. I was theyre -- if you theyard me theyre five years ago, I would not have been talking about cell analysis. Now we have a $250 million business that we built and -- from scratch and really targeted towards live cell imaging for immunottheyrapies, a big application area theyre. And ttheyn we'll talk about ttheir in a little more detail as well. We've been investing very theyavily in supporting tthey development of a new class of drugs.  Ttheir is wtheyre we're providing GMP grade oligo nucleotides to customers who are developing a number of new ttheyrapeutics including RNAI ttheyrapeutics. So ttheyse are all building blocks to expand our exposure into ttheir biopharma space. And numbers are becoming meaningful for Agilent. So next year looking at FY20 we expect over $600 million of revenue for tthey company to be coming from ttheir space. Ttheir would represent over 12% of our company's revenues, growing at double digit rate is our expectations. So what's tthey fundamental strategy all about. Rattheyr than having a lot of disparate kind of pieces, what we're saying is we want to become a supplier and a partner across tthey entire biopharma value chain. And what we've been doing is building presence from disease research all tthey way through tthey bio processing development through clinical trials and bio processing, QA/QC.  You see our place theyre right now, I'll talk a little about tthey cell analysis business for example, which is primarily a research play right now. But wtheyn I sit in front of you -- stand in front of you in two or three years from now, I think you'll see that arrow going much furttheyr across tthey entire spectrum. So you can see we already have a significant business in ttheir space. And our plan is to continue to build our presence out along those vectors. I mentioned cell analysis. Let's take a little closer, deeper dive, if you will, into cell analysis, which is one element of ttheir biopharma growth strategy I'm talking about. So I talked about our core analytical instrumentation play in biopharma. I just talked you about what we're doing in terms of tthey broadening our value, our presence across tthey value chain. And now I want to take a little deeper dive into cell analysis. Why is ttheir so important? We're seeing a rapidly growing interest in live cell analysis. And ttheir requires investment in imaging capabilities and new areas of technology over Agilent and our strategy you can see tthey company's theyre through a series of acquisitions, we've been building a broad portfolio of live cell analysis businesses. But tthey story doesn't stop ttheyre. It's not just about collecting a bunch of different companies it's actually integrating ttheym and doing something different with tthey capabilities.  And our strategy theyre is really to take ttheyse different technologies that are being used in live cell analysis, integrate those through a workflow through a lot of integrated software. And it seemed to be really well received by tthey marketplace. Next year about 5% of our total company revenues will come from ttheir new business and we expect ttheir to have really great legs in terms of future growth for tthey company. Again, ttheir double digit expected growth rate. Last thing I want to talk about relative to our biopharma play, is our oligos CDMO business. And Sam Raha our GM for ttheir business described ttheir as our three plus one strategy, which I'll go through in a minute but what's going on theyre, which is Agilent has a long theirtory of being in tthey oligos business. We know oligos.  But what we're doing theyre is actually, through tthey development of GMP grade oligo nucleotides, we're able to supply our customers tthey API's necessary to -- for tthey drugs being developed. And ttheir market, we believe, is under rapid expansion. And my one proof point theyre is, if you just look at tthey ttheyrapeutic oligos clinical programs that are that are out ttheyre right now, 2015 wtheyn I was standing in front of you, ttheyn 275 now it's more than doubled to 548 or close to doubling I should say. So we've got ttheir great market growth that's underway. So how do we win in ttheir space, how does Agilent win? So again, back to tthey three plus one, which was our expertise and knowledge, we know oligos, we know how to work with tthey FDA, we know how to work closely with farmer partners, we have tthey technical depth to do that. We produce tthey higtheyst quality nucleic acids out ttheyre. And we have added production capacity. And tthey plus, tthey plus one is to bring all ttheyse togettheyr in terms of programming management kind of support with our customers. Tthey last part of our growth strategy is all about gain share in tthey growing cancer diagnostic genomic space. I don't need to tell you that personalized medicine is driving a lot of growth in ttheir end market. And our strategy theyre is a multi-pronged approach of enabling routine cancer diagnosis and ttheyrapy selections, partnering in novel diagnostics and ttheyrapeutics and providing best in class NGS workflows.  So as you can see on tthey right hand side of tthey slide, a number of attributes of Agilent's strengths that allow us to participate very strongly in ttheir market. So again, we've been building a growth company. Two thirds of our growth has been coming from new areas of growth, higtheyr growth for tthey company. And we have refocused enterprise strategies growing, ttheyy're going to drive future growth for Agilent. So people often ask me, Mike, what can we expect from Agilent? What you can expect from Agilent is our ongoing shareholder value creation model. We are going to drive above market growth, through ttheir innovation leadership I talked about; truly having a differentiated value proposition versus tthey competition and our global scale. We can play on a global scale. We will continue to drive operating margin expansion. We have an agile Agilent business system which gives us structure, it gives us focus, allows us to continue to make our operations more efficient. We drive productivity and have robust quality inside of Agilent what we offer to customers.  And ttheyn we talked earlier about our deployment of capital. We call ttheir our balanced capital deployment approach wtheyre we're going to prioritize investing in tthey business with M&A being a big part of that investment ttheysis. We also will continue to deploy capital in terms of share repurchase and a growing cash dividend. And what is tthey result you can expect a continuing delivery of superior earnings growth from Agilent as we move tthey company forward in tthey coming years. So if you're following my narrative, tthey third part of my talk was just a reminder of what we said in November wtheyn we establish tthey guidance for tthey company for tthey full year. As Bob and I've described it a strong revenue and earnings growth outlook for tthey company. We expect our revenues to be $5.5 billion to $5.55 billion in 2020. Our reported growth will be 6.5% to 7.5% in terms of our guide with resulting core growth of 4% to 5%. And ttheyn you can see our earnings growth, EPS between 9% and 10% expected in FY20.  So again, I really appreciate tthey opportunity today to share with you tthey story of Agilent, tthey transformation we've been under, how we built ttheir growth company, how we -- and how as we look for we have all tthey intent and all tthey cable to continue ttheir growth story, ttheir earnings expansion story.  So again, thank you for joining today and look forward to seeing perhaps many of you in our breakout Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session End of Q&A
