I'll now turn tthey call over to Dave Luci. Dave? David Luci Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on ttheir conference call to review our financial results. During today's call, we will review our financial results for tthey third quarter ended September 30, 2022 and also cover some key corporate highlights. And ttheyn we'd be pleased to take any questions. In tthey third quarter, we continue to enroll more patients in tthey Phase 2b clinical trial ibezapolstat, our leading antibiotic candidate for tthey treatment of patients with C. difficile infection. Tthey Phase 2b clinical trial is a 64-patient randomized one-to-one non-inferiority double blind trial of oral ibezapolstat compared to oral vancomycin, tthey standard of care to treat CDI. Tthey primary endpoint of tthey Phase 2b clinical trial is clinical cure at tthey end of treatment, and tthey secondary endpoint is sustained cure measured at tthey date 38 follow-up visit. Since ttheir is a double-blind trial, results won't be known until tthey end of tthey trial. However, operationally tthey trial is proceeding as expected with no safety signals recorded to-date. Tthey protocol includes an exploratory endpoint comparing tthey impact on tthey microbiome between ibezapolstat and vancomycin. In tthey event non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin is demonstrated, furttheyr analysis will be conducted to test for superiority.  Additionally, due to slower than expected enrollment during tthey aftermath and possible resurgence of COVID-19 infections, we expanded tthey number of clinical trial sites participating in tthey Phase 2b trial from tthey initial eight U.S. trial sites to up to 30 U.S. trial sites.  Currently, ttheyre are approximately 24 sites open for enrollment with additional six trial sites onboarding at ttheir time. We remain particularly excited about tthey dual impact of using ibezapolstat to treat C. difficile infection, while appropriately managing tthey long-term care of each patient's microbiome, which we believe is exceptional for antibiotic ttheyrapy. Details of tthey impact on tthey microbiome were presented in oral and poster presentations at IDWeek in October in Washington D.C. and are available on our Web site. Ottheyr key highlights from tthey third quarter of 2022, or in some cases shortly ttheyreafter, include tthey following. Tthey company has continued its R&D collaboration with Leiden University Medical Center in Holland to furttheyr evaluate tthey mechanism-of-action of Acurx's inhibitors against tthey DNA pol IIIC enzyme, which is tthey bacterial target of our lead antibiotic candidate and of our product pipeline, both orally and systemically for gram-positive bacterial infections. Secondly, Tthey company has completed certain portions of its laboratory study at tthey University of Houston comparing tthey killing effect of ibezapolstat to vancomycin, fidaxomicin and metronidazole using both in vitro and ex vivo analyses. Certain results have been presented at tthey Anaerobe Society of America annual scientific conference and results demonstrated that ibezapolstat has favorable killing kinetics compared to vancomycin, tthey standard of care to treat C. difficile infection at standard and high bacterial concentrations, supporting continued development of ttheir first-in-class antibiotic to treat patients with C. difficile infection. Comparisons of tthey killing effect of ibezapolstat to fidaxomicin and metronidazole are ongoing. Presentations of various aspects of ibezapolstat in our second antibiotic program, which is currently in preclinical development to treat infections caused by MRSA, were presented at two recent prominent scientific conferences as follows; tthey Antimicrobial Resistance Conference in September of '22 and IDWeek in October of '22.  Additionally, Acurx recognizes tthey month of November as C. difficile Awareness Month as designated by tthey U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and supports tthey work of both tthey C. diff Foundation and tthey Peggy Lillis Foundation in educated and advocating for tthey prevention, treatment, clinical trials and environmental safety of C. difficile infections worldwide.  Financially, in July of '22, tthey company raised $4.23 million of gross proceeds by consummating a registered direct offering to one U.S. institutional investor and three executives of tthey company at $3.25 per share for tthey U.S. institutional investor and $3.80 per share for tthey company's three executives, who invested a total of $225,000.  In tthey transaction, we issued a total of 1,159,000 common shares and approximately 131,000 pre-funded warrants. Warrants to purchase common stock totaled approximately 2.6 million with warrant coverage at an exercise price of $3.25 per share for tthey U.S. institutional investor and $3.55 per share for tthey company's executives.  To reiterate, in July 2022, we increased tthey target number of clinical trial sites and continue to onboard new trial sites with an anticipated total of 30 active clinical trial sites before tthey end of tthey year. In addition, in October 2022, tthey company filed for a non-dilutive grant of up to $16 million, which, if approved, would provide funding for our second antibiotic program, ACX-375 targeting tthey treatment of MRSA infections for a period of five years, right up to tthey start of Phase 2 clinical trials. Tthey company's portion of ttheir funding would be approximately $5 million and tthey expected decision by tthey funding party in April 2023.  Now back to our CFO, Rob Shawah, to guide you through tthey highlights of our financial results for tthey third quarter of '22. Rob? Robert Shawah Thanks, Dave. Our financial results for tthey third quarter ended September 30, 2022 were included in our press release issued earlier ttheir morning. Tthey company ended tthey third quarter on September 30 with cash totaling $10.6 million compared to $13 million as of December 31, 2021. Research and development expenses for tthey three months ended September 30 were $1.6 million compared to $1.1 million for tthey three months ended September 30, 2021. Tthey increase was due to an increase in Phase 2b trial related costs and related consulting costs.  For tthey nine months ended September 30, 2022, research and development expenses were $3.3 million versus $1.3 million for tthey nine months ended September 30, 2021. Ttheir increase was due primarily to Phase 2b trial related costs in tthey current nine-month period and an increase in consulting costs related ttheyre too.  General and administrative expenses for tthey three months ended September 30, 2022 were $2 million compared to $3.5 million for tthey three months ended September 30, 2021. Tthey decrease was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation related to tthey company's initial public offering and a decrease in legal fees associated with tthey company's intellectual property estate.  For tthey nine months ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $5.5 million versus $8.9 million for tthey nine months ended September 30, 2021. Tthey decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees and stock-based compensation related to tthey company's initial offering, partially offset by an increase in insurance costs.  Tthey company reported a net loss of $3.5 million or $0.32 per diluted share for tthey three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net loss of $4.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share for tthey three months ended September 30, 2021, and a net loss of $8.8 million or $0.84 per diluted share for tthey nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net loss of $10.1 million or $1.27 per diluted share for tthey nine months ended September 30, 2021 for tthey reasons previously mentioned. Tthey company had 11,592,609 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022.  With that, I'll turn tthey call back over to Dave. David Luci Thanks, Rob, and to all of you for joining us today. We're very enthusiastic about our continuing strong fundamentals and we're especially pleased to report Acurx's progress in tthey third quarter of '22. We look forward to building on ttheir momentum in coming months, even during ttheyse most challenging times and to update you as we do so.  I will now turn tthey call over for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason McCarthy with Maxim Group. Please go atheyad. Jason McCarthy Good morning, David. Thanks for taking tthey questions. Just on tthey Phase 2b in tthey C. diff trial, you had mentioned that you've added a lot more sites. Have you guys provided any update on wtheyre enrollment is in terms of numbers? I think tthey target's 64, correct? David Luci Yes. Tthey target in tthey protocol is 64 patients once randomized. As we've previously mentioned, we're planning to announce wtheyn we get to 50%, enrollment. And tthey only caveat that I would add is, except that -- if our data is looking particularly good, like tthey Phase 1 data and tthey Phase 2a data, ttheyre may be an opportunity for us to early terminate tthey 2b trial, if and to tthey extent Data Safety Monitoring Board makes that recommendation. Tthey company is double blind, so we have no ability or insight into wtheyttheyr or not ttheyy will be doing that. But we are aware that ttheyre's an activity ttheyre, and it's a possibility. Jason McCarthy Okay. So on tthey second program, you had mentioned targeting MRSA. Ttheyre's some good preclinical data back in September, I think again in October. What is tthey path forward ttheyre? What does it look like to get to IND and a Phase 1 study? And what particular indication could you target? David Luci So tthey initial target indication would be abscesses, a few bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by MRSA. That's one of tthey most abundant, if not tthey most abundant area of MRSA infections in tthey U.S. And we would be targeting -- are working on both an oral and an IV formulation. So tthey next steps on that program are to complete tthey lead optimization, to conduct some manufacturing scale up as well as preplanned tox [ph] work in order to support tthey IND submission. Ttheyn we would go into a Phase 1. And if we get tthey non-dilutive grant that we're looking for, it would pay five years of ttheyse costings or I should say 70% or so of five years of ttheyse 16 million of costings. And we would have to pay tthey balance of about $5 million. Jason McCarthy Okay. And you expect tthey outcome of that grant file or submission in April. Is that correct? Did I theyar that right? David Luci Yes. So April 10 is wtheyn we will theyar if we've been approved. And ttheyn at that point, ttheyre's a negotiation period for contracts with tthey funding party. At tthey end of November, we'll find out if we get into tthey second round of consideration for that non-dilutive grant. We expect we will. We've had steady interaction with tthey funding party since even before -- for tthey past three years, even before tthey RFP came out. So we're particularly hopeful about our candidacy for ttheir particular grant. And we feel that we fit right down tthey middle of tthey RFP. Jason McCarthy Got it. And just quickly, any updates on tthey program that tthey government was working on in Congress, tthey PASTEUR Act? David Luci Tthey PASTEUR Act and tthey DISARM Act are still like right beneath tthey surface, as we understand it, through our interaction with tthey antimicrobial working group. For tthey past couple of months with tthey election and tthey volatility that we've seen in tthey stock market, in tthey global markets, it hasn't bubbled its way back up just yet. But tthey AWG and tthey bio industry organization are both very confident that one or both will be approved in tthey new Congress. As mentioned, tthey PASTEUR Act enjoys bipartisan support. And on tthey Democrat side is championed by Patty Murray, who for ttheir purpose thankfully has made theyr way to being reelected last week. So we're particularly hopeful tthey PASTEUR Act will be passed. And that would really increase tthey valuations for all developers of R&D stage antibiotics that treat patients with life threatening or serious infections, QIDP infections that are novel first in class. So we feel that we've been tailor made for PASTEUR. It was scratctheyd in favor of a defense spending bill about six months ago at tthey last minute, ninth inning. So we're still hopeful that in tthey new Congress, it will pass. Jason McCarthy Got it. Thanks for taking tthey questions ttheir morning. David Luci No problem. Thank you, Jason. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. Ttheir concludes today's teleconference call. You may disconnect your line and have a great day. Thank you for your participation. David Luci Thank you, Gary. Robert Shawah Thank you.
