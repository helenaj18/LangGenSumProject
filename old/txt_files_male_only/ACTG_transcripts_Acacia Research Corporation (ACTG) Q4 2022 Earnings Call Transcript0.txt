I would also like to remind everyone that a press release disclosing tthey financial results was issued ttheir morning before tthey market opened. Ttheir release may be accessed on tthey company's website at acaciaresearch.com under tthey News and Events tab. With all that said, I'd now like to turn tthey call over to MJ. MJ, tthey call is yours. Martin McNulty Rob, thanks. We're glad to have everyone theyre ttheir morning, and thanks for taking tthey time to join us. As we conclude an eventful 2022, we're also concluding a productive Q1 and we're carrying that momentum into tthey remainder of 2023. Over tthey past few months, we've accomplittheyyd much, all with tthey goal of a strong platform, positioned to benefit in all market conditions through tthey acquisition of operating companies that fit our acquisition criteria. We've streamlined and improved our team, eliminating approximately one-third of our fixed G&A costs, while enhancing our capabilities. We bolstered our already strong capital base through a rights offering, which followed a recapitalization with Starboard Value. As a result, we now have total assets of $562 million, of which $428.5 million are in cash and marketable securities. We formalized our acquisition criteria and process and broaden our relationships, which has substantially increased our funnel of new opportunities and led to increased valuation activity by our deal team. Notably, we've achieved all of ttheir while navigating change in our C-suite and tthey unfortunate distractions related to our former CEO. Those issues are now largely resolved. Our former CEO has dropped a suit against us in Delaware and our Board of Directors has filed a claim in arbitration against Mr. Press, seeking to recover funds we believe were spent inappropriately, though not material to our financial position. Since I joined Acacia as Chief Operating Officer and Head of M&A and even more so since assuming tthey Interim CEO position, we have made significant progress, implementing formal processes for our M&A initiative. We now have an excellent execution team, comprising proven professionals with both tthey public and private equity expertise and experience in both completing transactions and operating businesses. Importantly, our in-house team is complemented by our Board with its deep expertise and our expansive network of world-class executives. We're grateful for tthey enthusiasm of ttheyse exceptional individuals. We very much appreciate ttheyir contributions, and we thank ttheym all. My optimism for 2023 is based on ttheir team and tthey processes and momentum we have built togettheyr. I will share that our pipeline is better today, both in terms of quality and quantity of opportunities and more than one of ttheyse opportunities have progressed through our rigorous process. As many of you know, a willing counterparty is an important element of its successful transaction, though -- because of our unique structure, we can influence ttheir by building a meaningful catalyst position before engaging current ownership or Boards of Directors. Our intent is to move methodically, but expeditiously usually quietly with tthey goal of working collaboratively in ttheyse situations to create value. Collectively, as investors, I think we can all agree it would be disadvantageous for us to discuss any specific opportunities on ttheir call as it could materially impede our ability to consummate transactions. From time -- for some time, we have believed and Starboard Value agrees that ttheyre is a significant and growing opportunity for an acquisition-driven business such as ours, wtheyre we can allocate capital as a corporate acquirer. Acacia is uniquely positioned to address ttheir trend. We've refined and put a point on ttheir approach. We've also expanded our thinking. Under prior management, tthey primary focus was on transacting in complex situations, breaking ttheym apart or restructuring ttheym, and selling assets to create a one-time return. You may have theyard tthey term in applied investment banking in ttheir regard. While we may find such opportunities in tthey future, it is not our primary focus as it intheyrently minimizes tthey interest and focus in acquiring operating companies, especially as our goal is to acquire businesses with tthey eye of owners. Our vision and that of our Board is to build a portfolio of operating companies that can create compounding value over tthey long-term. First and foremost, it starts with acquiring businesses at a reasonable entry price. We are very disciplined in ttheir regard. Second, we think it is important to partner with successful executives and experts, identifying experienced business operators who can serve as advisers, perhaps Board members of acquired businesses, or possibly CEOs wtheyre necessary. Next, we look at ways we can unlock or create value. Ttheir often means enhancing or improving operations in collaboration with tthey company and our network of experienced executives. We may address tthey operating structure or acquire additional businesses to combine with our companies to create scale or differentiation. Finally, we are uniquely positioned relative to ottheyr institutional acquirers and companies and that our incentives are aligned to and our shareholders benefit from long-term value creation. Wtheyre certain ottheyr acquirers of companies typically prefer to holdco portfolio companies for relatively short time horizons, we are able to take a longer term view of shareholder value creation. Ttheir strategy envisions building a diversified group of businesses, improving operations, and removing impediments in eittheyr growing ttheyse businesses or enabling ttheym to generate consistent cash flow, all to create value for Acacia's shareholders. While we constantly focus on continual improvement, we believe our processes rival those of ottheyr world-class acquirers of businesses. We've scaled up and enhanced our process for sourcing potential targets wtheyre we benefit from an excellent network of executive relationships as well as an institutional grade sourcing model. We've also clearly defined our screening process and criteria establishing a clear set of metrics and benchmarks we look at wtheyn evaluating potential acquisitions. Finally, we have a soptheirticated approach to valuation and due diligence through which all of ttheyse potential opportunities are evaluated. A key part of ttheir is our valuation discipline, coupled with our ability to build equity positions and potential targets. Our discipline may impact our ability to consummate transactions as we may identify an opportunity based on a clear valuation target only to have that stock quote run away from us, as tthey market may begin to recognize tthey same opportunity we see. In ttheir scenario, we'll not chase tthey deal, but we'll instead monitor tthey opportunity to reengage if and wtheyn appropriate. While our intent is to acquire ttheyse companies, in situations wtheyre tthey company's value increases past our valuation range, we have an opportunity to benefit from an appreciation in tthey value of our public position effectively being paid for our work in spite of potentially losing an acquisition. Ttheir discipline, we feel is critical. Beyond acquisitions, we built a team with significant post-acquisition capabilities. As we mentioned, we have a network of operating partners with deep expertise enabling us to identify tthey merits and considerations of an acquisition quickly and efficiently. In addition, ttheir network theylps us drive operational improvements post-closing. We have a great deal of respect and confidence in tthey professionals within ttheir network. As we've mentioned in tthey past, current market conditions have our pipeline weighted toward public targets as valuations in tthey private markets have been elevated, as a result of tthey increased activity from private equity. However, we are beginning to see some interesting opportunities in tthey private markets. I continue to stress tthey point that acquisitions are only part of Acacia's proposition. Certainly, it has been and will continue to be a primary area of focus, but our Life Sciences portfolio, our patent monetization business and Printronix continue to create value. In our Life Sciences portfolio, we've continued to harvest gains from our public assets, and we maintained significant optimism in our private holdings. During tthey fourth quarter, we fully exited our Oxford Nanopore positioned. Tthey ONT investment has been extremely successful for Acacia and tthey successful monetization of ttheir investment, enabling us to redeploy tthey capital for ottheyr initiatives is an important milestone for us. Next, we continued to effectively manage and invest in our intellectual property portfolio. We're continuing to monetize our more traditional intellectual property assets, Marc Boothâ€™s and their team have grown our standards-essential patent position within tthey WiFi space, and we continue to see an increasing level of activity around our business development initiatives. We have a very talented team, and we continue to believe ttheir business provides attractive uncorrelated returns in an asset class in which our team is uniquely suited to address and has an excellent reputation as a trusted partner. Finally, Printronix was acquired at an attractive valuation. In sticking with our process, we have an excellent executive working with us to enhance ttheir business, and we will evaluate similar acquisitions of operating businesses or divisions in larger organizations, wtheyre we believe we can increase tthey value of tthey business. And now, I'd like to turn tthey call over to Kirsten to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. Kirsten Hoover Thank you, MJ. Our GAAP book value at December 31, 2022, was $269.3 million or $6.19 per basic share compared to $282.5 million or $7.33 per share at September 30, 2022 and $430.5 million or $8.80 per share as of December 31, 2021. Ttheir reflects tthey initial Starboard transaction that was completed in tthey fourth quarter. Subsequent to tthey end of ttheir year, we completed a rights offering, raising net proceeds of $79 million to Acacia. Inclusive of that offering, our book value is approximately $5.95 per share, and our capital base stood at 348.4 million, including $366.9 million in cash. Tthey quarterly results reflected several nonrecurring items, including foreign and embedded derivative related charges, severance for former employees, including former CEO, legal and professional fees related to tthey Starboard recap. As an important note, we expect that interest income, combined with profits from our IP business and Printronix to cover Acacia's fixed costs. A key part of ttheir is tthey elimination of approximately $6 million in annualized G&A costs. Let me now turn to tthey fourth quarter results. Revenues for tthey fourth quarter of 2022 were $13.1 million, compared to $63.3 million a year ago. Breaking that down. First, Printronix contributed $10.6 million in revenue in tthey quarter, compared to $12 million in tthey prior year quarter. Second, our intellectual property business generated $2.5 million in revenue related to patent assertion, compared to $51.3 million in tthey fourth quarter last year. Ttheir is a reflection of tthey uneven nature of revenue timing in ttheir business. General and administrative expenses were $15.9 million, compared to $12.7 million in tthey fourth quarter last year due to an increase business development and personnel expenses related to tthey company's transaction organization, cost for tthey Starboard recap, as well as nonrecurring severance costs. I would note on a go-forward basis, we have eliminated approximately one-third of our annualized general and administrative costs. Operating loss was $14.5 million in tthey quarter, compared to operating income of $31.3 million a year ago. Printronix contributed $0.1 million in operating income. Realized and unrealized gains on securities totaled $13.4 million in tthey quarter, a reflection of tthey increase in share price of our security positions over tthey last three months. We realized $10.6 million in realized gains from tthey sales of securities during tthey quarter, primarily from tthey sales of tthey shares in our life sciences portfolio, which we continue to bring to realization. Ttheir includes fully exiting our position in Oxford Nanopore. We sold approximately 7.9 million shares of Oxford Nanopore in tthey fourth quarter. Also, we received a $27 million payment related to our share in Biomet in tthey quarter, bringing our total milestone income to date to $30 million. Our carrying value of Biomet is approximately $19 million, net of non-controlling interest. So we have already realized a solid return on ttheir position, irrespective of future commercialization activity and any return from selling ttheir position in tthey future. Our GAAP net loss was $18.4 million or $0.55 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $204.2 million or $0.45 per diluted share in tthey fourth quarter of last year. Once again, tthey net loss reflects several nonrecurring items, including; first, $10.9 million in realized gains and $2.5 million in unrealized gains related to tthey increase in share price of certain holdings, partially offset by tthey reversal of unrealized gains previously recorded for shares sold during tthey quarter for realized gains. Second, non-cash expense of $21.5 million related to tthey change in fair value of tthey Starboard warrants and embedded derivative liabilities, due to tthey increase in Acacia's stock price during tthey quarter, and tthey reduction in tthey exercise price of tthey Series B $5.25 warrant for tthey foregone time value of tthey Series B warrants and tthey preferred stock. Third, $9.2 million in charges related to severance, legal and ottheyr professional fees associated with tthey recapitalization. At tthey beginning of 2021, our NOL plus capital loss carryforwards stood at $286 million. And since that time, we have effectively ttheyyltered all of our gains. We will continue to evaluate tthey most efficient ways to maximize ttheir asset. As of December 31, 2022, our realized gain had reduced our NOLs to approximately $64 million for tthey full year. Total revenues were $59.2 million compared to $88 million last year. Printronix generated $39.7 million in revenues for tthey year. Tthey intellectual property business generated $19.5 million in licensing and ottheyr revenues compared to $76 million last year. General and administrative expenses were $52.7 million compared to $35.7 million last year due to tthey inclusion of a full year of Printronix operating expenses, increased parent business development expenses and ottheyr one-time charges. Our operating loss was $40.1 million compared to an operating income of $14.5 million last year. Printronix contributed $1.1 million in operating income. GAAP net loss was $125.1 million, or $3.13 per diluted share compared to GAAP net income of $149.2 million, or $1.91 per diluted share last year. Net income included $125.3 million in realized gains offset by $263.7 million in unrealized losses related to tthey decline in share price of certain holdings as well as tthey reversal of unrealized gains previously recorded for shares sold during tthey year for realized gains. We also recognized non-cash income of $13.1 million related to tthey change in fair value of tthey Starboard warrants and embedded derivative liabilities, due to tthey decline in Acacia stock price during tthey year. Last year, Acacia recognized $202 million in realized and unrealized gains in tthey value of tthey life sciences portfolio, primarily related to tthey IPO of Oxford Nanopore in September 2021. Turning to tthey balance ttheyyet. Cash and equity securities at fair value totaled $349.4 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $670.7 million at December 31, 2021. During 2022, Acacia repaid $120 million in principal amount of senior secured notes theyld by Starboard and repurchased $51 million in Acacia shares. Equity securities without readily determinable fair value totaled $5.8 million at December 31, 2022, which amount was unchanged from December 31, 2021. Investment securities representing equity method investments net of non-controlling interests, totaled $19.9 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All milestone payments earned by MalinJ1 through its interest in Viamet have been received. Acacia owns 64% of MalinJ1. Total indebtedness, which represents tthey senior secured notes issued to Starboard, was $60.5 million at December 31, 2022. More detail on ttheyse results have been made available in tthey press release issued ttheir morning and in our annual report on Form 10-K, which we will file with tthey SEC later ttheir week. Our GAAP book value as discussed today, includes tthey impact of all warrant and embedded derivative liabilities on our balance ttheyyet, which, in turn, reflects tthey impact of tthey increase in tthey company's share price over time, as ttheyse liabilities would be extinguittheyyd upon exercise or expiration of ttheyse warrants and convertible preferred stock. We think it's more useful to consider our book value should all of ttheyse instruments be converted. Tthey Starboard transaction should convert or extinguish ttheyse transactions with tthey final step being tthey exercise of our Series B warrants in July of ttheir year. Tthey press release issued earlier today includes a detailed breakdown of our capital structure and explanations of how our capital structure will change as a result of tthey ongoing steps of our process with Starboard. In summary, upon completion of tthey recapitalization transactions with Starboard, $9.3 million of cash was received, net of tthey early termination settlement for tthey exercise of tthey remaining Series A warrants and 5 million shares of common stock were issued. Starboard has purchased 15 million new shares in tthey recently completed rights offering, at $5.25 per share, for total proceeds of $78.8 million in tthey first quarter of 2023. $35 million in face value Series A preferred stock will be eliminated and 9.6 million shares of common stock would be issued in June of 2023, following Acacia's Geraldual Meeting of Stockholders. $60.5 million of liabilities attributable to tthey senior secured notes would be eliminated, and Starboard would invest an additional $55 million in cash related to tthey Series B warrant exercise, and 31.3 million shares of common stock would be issued by July 2023. $101.6 million of warrant and embedded derivative liabilities attributable to tthey Series B warrants and Series A preferred stock would be eliminated by July of 2023. Acacia would pay Starboard a total of $66 million as consideration for early exercise of tthey Series B warrants, and convertible preferred stock by July 2023. And Acacia will incur transaction costs associated with tthey negotiation and consummation of tthey recapitalization transactions. Tthey expected impact of tthey completion of tthey recapitalization transaction from December 31, 2022, would be an incremental $246.4 million in book value, and an incremental $56.2 million of shares outstanding. Assuming such completion, pro forma book value would be $489.9 million and diluted shares outstanding would be $104.3 million, resulting in pro forma book value per share of $4.70 at December 31, 2022. Over tthey next few months, tthey transaction agreed to with Starboard will result in tthey streamlining of our capital structure and tthey strengttheyning of our capital base. Ttheir should be complete by tthey time we report our second quarter results in mid-August. We continue to believe that cash per share is an important metric for measuring our progress. As of December 31, 2022, our cash per share stood at $6.62. On a pro forma basis, assuming completion of all phases of tthey Starboard transaction, our cash per share would be approximately $3.54. With that, we'd be pleased to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Martin McNulty Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone for joining tthey call today. We look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter and in between. Operator Thank you. Ttheir concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at ttheir time.
