Adjusted funds from operations, AFFO was $0.47 per share-diluted. Since inception of tthey common stock repurchase program in August, we repurchased nearly 8% of our outstanding common shares through March 31, 2016. Net interest income increased $1.6 million, or 7%, as compared to tthey three months ended March 31, 2015. RSO, tthey company liquidated its investment in RREF CDO 2006-1, a commercial real estate CRE, CDO on April 25, 2015 and received tthey remaining collateral of $66.3 million in exchange for its remaining interest after paying off tthey CDO debt. GAAP net income allocable to common shares was $0.31 per share-diluted. Adjusted for tthey residential mortgage servicing rights mark-to-market, it would have been $0.39 per share. Economic book value was 17.73, and we paid a dividend of $0.42. With those highlights out of tthey way, I will now introduce my colleagues. With me today are Dave Bloom, Head of Real Estate; David Bryant, our Chief Financial Officer; and Purvi Kamdar, our Director of Investor Relations. Earning from our core commercial real estate business were strong ttheir quarter, and we expect ttheym to be stronger respectively. We also saw a good performance in Northport, our middle market corporate credit business. We continue to see stable credit statistics, exemplifying tthey result of prune lending through rigorous underwritings Our existing tern financing facilities in CRE securitizations give us certainty in our financing sources at attractive spreads and we see tthey markets re-price risk across all sectors. During tthey first quarter, we had nearly $50 million of CRE loan originations, including funding of obligations of existing loans as we focus on liquidating and refinancing properties and position tthey company for solid originations. We expect our originations to be in tthey range of $400 million to $600 million for 2016, mostly taking place in tthey latter half of tthey year. As we have stated previously, we have been committed to repurchasing our security. Since tthey inception of our buyback program through tthey end of tthey first quarter, we have repurchased almost $37 million of our security. Tthey company repurchased over $33 million of its common stock, which represents approximately 8% outstanding common shares. We have also bought back approximately 3.5% of our outstanding Preferred B shares. In tthey quarter, we saw significant opportunities to generate yield for our shareholders via our share repurchase plans and executed on common share repurchase that were accretive to book value by $0.13. We look forward to continuing ttheir in 2016 if those opportunities present ttheymselves. Accordingly on March 15th, our board authorized a repurchase plan of up to an additional $50 million of tthey company's outstanding securities. During our last call, we stated that we would begin to recycle capital from our legacy CRE, CDOs and bank loans CDOs over tthey next year. Last week we called and liquidated our investment in RREF CDO 2006-1, our first CRE, CDO, which closed in August of 2006 and had $345 million of assets at closing. We received tthey remaining collateral of $66 million in exchange of our equity interest after paying off tthey CDO debt. I want to note that ttheir securitization which invested just before tthey beginning of tthey great financial crisis paid every bond, in full and on time. It never failed in interest coverage or over collateralization debt. We think that’s a remarkable achievement for a transaction with vintage and we are proud of that. As we have previously indicated, we believe that Northport, our middle market lending business is ultimately non-optimized by being a REIT subsidiary even though tthey business continues to perform very well and we are proud of our – its profitable growth, it gained [ph] just in over 2 years. In tthey fourth quarter, Northport received $105 million of repayments, which resulted in $2.6 million of prepayment fees providing capital for us to recycle into our business. As we focus on reallocating our capital to our CRE lending business, Northports assets were reduced from $376 million to $322 million during tthey quarter and we anticipate furttheyr reduction. We are exploring several options in which we can get at a better structure outside of a REIT and expect to have clarity on ttheir in tthey near future. Wtheyn we do so, tthey capital currently allocated to Northport will be redeployed into our core CRE business. I also want to update you on our residential mortgage business, Primary Capital Mortgage or PCM. In March and April PCM operated profitably, except that we were required to mark as – our mortgage servicing rights to market and that we took a $2.5 million non-cash reserve. Tthey MSRs are continuing to provide volatility to our financial statements and we will review our strategy with respect to ttheym. While ttheir operating segment impacted our net income for tthey quarter, it has achieved operating profitability and we think it will contribute to net income going forward. Please note that between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over $29 million to our shareholders in 2016 quarter one. We remain steadfast in our commitment to maximizing shareholder value. We are reiterating our guidance of at least $2.65 per share of AFFO and at least $1.50 per share of GAAP net income. Now I will ask Dave Bloom to review our real estate activities. Dave Bloom Thank you, Jonathan. Resource Capital Corp.’s committed commercial mortgage and CMBS portfolio has a current balance in excess of $1.85 billion and a granular and diverse pool. RSO’s commercial mortgage portfolio is a 100% self-originated and is comprised of 88 individual whole loans with an aggregate committed balance of approximately $1.8 billion. Tthey underlying collateral base securing RSO’s commercial mortgage portfolio is in geographically varied markets with loans secured by asset in major used categories. Tthey portfolio is broken down as follows, 42% multifamily, 21% office, 21% retail, 15% hotel and 1% ottheyr such as mixed used properties. Since tthey start of 2016, we closed $56.1 million of new loans. Over tthey trailing 12 months ending March 31, RSO originated $642 million of new loans, inclusive of commitments for future fundings across 35 separate positions. On our last call, I explained that in tthey fourth quarter of last year, although we remained in tthey market, we pulled back on originations due to what we felt to be a significant mis-pricing of risk in our long establittheyyd bridge lending business. We continue to take measured approach to new originations as tthey market has been recalibrating. During tthey first quarter we were focused on increasing equity for new loans through liquidating lower leverage, legacy securitization, which allow us to originate new loans at our mid-teens return targets. As Jonathan mentioned, in late April, RSO liquidated our 2006 securitization, received our equity interest in approximately $66 million of collateral that is in tthey process of being optimally financed. Ttheir will free up equity to invest in new loans, as well as increase return on tthey existing collateral during its short remaining duration. RSOs 2007 securitization is also being prepared for liquidation, and as with tthey liquidation of tthey 2006 transaction through tthey proper re-leveraging we will again optimize returns of any remaining collateral unlock equity that will be used for no originations. In general, CMBS markets still remains volatile, and as I have stated in tthey past, while we do not originate any long-term fixed rate loans for tthey securitization market, CRE, CLO pricing tends to track tthey broader CMBS market. As CMBS markets continue to firm, we contemplate our return to tthey CRE, CLO market. RSO has been tthey most prolific issue of CRE, CLOs and has termed financed approximately $1.5 billion of collateral in four separate transactions from December 2013 through August of 2015. Tthey RSO deals were well received by tthey market and have had a total of 38 separate institutional investors that participated in our CRE CLO transactions. As ttheir market continues to return, we will again access it to efficiently term finance our new loan production. As I have previously noted, RSO is not dependent on capita market taxes in tthey CRE CLO market. We have great deal of capacity on our term facilities with our commercial banking partners. To that end, I am pleased to report that we are in tthey process of documenting a new $400 million five year term financing facility with Wells Fargo, which will replace tthey Wells facility that we have had in place since early 2012. We are again actively building a forward pipeline of new loan opportunities and look forward to returning to a normalized pace of originations, ramping up through tthey second quarter. We currently anticipate 2016 origination volume to be between $400 and $600 million. We have remained active through tthey recent retrenchment and are seeing new lending opportunities increasing week-by-week. As banks are pulling back in overall direct balance ttheyyet lending, and with tthey absence of floating rate CMBS option, RSO is well positioned as bridge lending platform with over 10 years of theirtory and in excess of $3.5 billion of loans closed. Tthey wall of maturities from 2006 and 2007 CMBS loans will surely drive transaction volume for tthey next few years. As many assets will trade to value add buyers. In addition, tthey uncertain execution in tthey CMBS market is driving many owners with high quality stabilized properties away from long-term financing and towards short term financing with certainty of execution. Real estate fundamentals have remained largely in ctheyck and we see an increasing demand for our core floating rate bridge loan program. At ttheir point, we feel tthey market is clearly moving towards us. With markets fundamentals playing in our favor, and tthey proven ability to term finance our loans in eittheyr CRE CLOs or on facilities provided by our commercial banking partners, as RSO continues to allocate more capital to tthey core CRE platform, we are optimistic about growing net interest margins and overall profitability in a meaningful way. Our primary focus remains as always on credit. Our core lending philosophy places tthey ultimate premium on asset quality, location and business plan with significant focus on sponsor experience and financial strength. Once again ttheir quarter RSOs commercial real estate loan portfolio is performing with no defaults. With that, I'll turn it back to Jonathan and rejoin you for Q&A at tthey end of tthey call. Thank you. Jonathan Cotheyn As always, thank you, Dave Bloom. Now I will ask Dave Bryant, our CFO to discuss tthey financials. David Bryant Thank you, Jonathan. Resource Capital Corp. declared and paid a cash dividend for tthey first quarter of $0.42 per common share. Our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for tthey quarter was $14.7 million or $0.47 per common share, a payout ratio of 89%. In determining AFFO for tthey first quarter, ttheyre were several non-cash adjustments that netted to approximately $5 million. Ttheyse non-cash items included amortization of deferred cost and discounts from our convertible senior notes, valuation reserves on residential mortgage origination, mortgage servicing rights and adjustments related to share based compensation. Tthey deconsolidation of our two legacy real estate CDOs RREF 2006 and RREF 2007 and our one remaining bank loan CDO Apidos Cinco resulted in a reclassification of tthey assets. Interest rate swaps, and debt theyld at December 31, to what is essentially a net amount representing available for sale securities theyld in each CDO. Accordingly, we recorded tthey required adjustments for estimated fair value through retained earnings and we'll record income on a net effective yield basis on ttheyse investments going forward. We passed all of tthey interest coverage and over collateralization tests in each of our securitizations that required ttheyse tests, including tthey deconsolidated real estate CDOs and remaining bank loan CLO. Our three most recent securitizations in - one in 2014 and two in 2015 are subject only to over collateralization tests, which we have comfortably passed. Ttheyse structured finance vehicles again performed well and produced theyalthy cash flow to us in tthey first quarter. We now have total capacity of $650 million on our real estate term facilities and availability of $392 million as of March 31. We see that our commercial real estate portfolio is now comprised of 100% self-originated whole loans and ttheir core business is providing us with several benefits. We have a strong track record with tthey credit quality, one are originated real estate loans. We also have weighted average LIBOR floors of 27 basis points on $1.4 billion of loans of which $1 billion are in our four real estate securitizations and have terms remaining from 1 to 4.5 years, and weighted average floor of 0.9%. Ttheir means that any potential increases in LIBOR will be accretive to our earnings. In Q1, we booked provisions for loan losses of 37,000. We ended tthey period with $1.5 million in commercial real estate allowances and $2.7 million in middle market loan allowances. In terms of delinquencies all of our $322 million middle market loans are current and as Dave Bloom mentioned each of our real estate loans are current with respect to debt service payments due from our borrowers. Our leverage decreased to two times at March 31 from 2.3 times at December 31, 2015. Most of ttheir decline and leverage is due to tthey deconsolidation previously discussed. Wtheyn we treat our TruPS issuances which have a remaining term of approximately 20 years, as equity leverage is 1.8 times. With regard to real estate leverage, we ended Q1 at 2.4 times on our entire portfolio, including cash earmarked for new real estate loan originations. We remain focused on getting our real estate equity allocation increased to a minimum of 75%. Overall, our weighted average cost of capital from all sources was 5.53% at March 31. We ended tthey March 31 quarter with a GAAP book value per share of $17.12, down from $17.63 at December 31. We had earnings of $0.31 and saw an accretive benefit of $0.13 per share from tthey share repurchase plan. We paid dividends of $0.42 per share and had a $0.55 reduction due to tthey deconsolidation adjustments, which we consider temporary and picked up $0.02 from marks on securities and interest rate theydges. Economic book value as Jon mentioned is 17.73 per share and ttheir metric serves to provide our investors with economic basis, as we expect to again substantially recover our investments in ttheyse deconsolidated vehicles. Inefficient to tthey common shares we purchased during a period, we repurchased RSO Preferred Series B preferred stock during Q1, which provided a $0.05 benefit to common share earnings as we retired those shares. We look forward to continuing to implement tthey stock buyback plan in 2016 as liquidity allows us and as we continue to trade well below book value on our common and preferred stock. We have relatively low leverage and are substantially match funded with non-recourse floating rate, term financing on tthey vast majority of our lending platform. In addition to tthey liquidation of our initial real estate securitization from 2006, we also anticipate recycling capital from our remaining legacy real estate CDO in 2007 and a legacy bank loan CLO, which should happen over tthey next 12 months, each of ttheyse will provide us substantial cash on our liquidation. We can deploy ttheyse proceeds in higtheyr return on equity investments, as ttheyse legacy financings have been substantially delevered. Our selective re-use of tthey recycle capital will theylp us cautiously grow our real estate portfolio, improve core earnings quality, along with tthey utmost focus on credit. With that my formal remarks are completed. And I'll turn tthey call back to Jonathan Cotheyn. Jonathan Cotheyn Thank you, Dave. In summary, we are pleased with wtheyre we are and continue to maintain a consistent focus on credit quality, high underwriting standards and vigilant management of our investments. Our leverage remains low, and we have an experienced and dedicated management team that will carefully monitor our risk, while continuing to look forward to a stable dividend. We thank you for your continued support. And with that I will open up tthey call to any questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from tthey line of Steve Delaney from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Steve Delaney Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on tthey progress in tthey first quarter, really nice… Jonathan Cotheyn Thank you, Steve… Steve Delaney Covered by AFFO. I was struck tthey - your comments about projected origination volume of 400 to 600 after what was a slower start to tthey year. And I am just curious if you guys were trying or you're looking out to tthey second half of tthey year and you are seeing sctheyduled maturities and are you some how trying to match tthey flow of your origination pipeline against tthey actual pay-offs that you have coming in later in tthey year? Jonathan Cotheyn Thanks, Steve. Good question. We're really doing two things in my opinion and Dave Bloom can add whatever to ttheir. One is that we are moving dollars from non-CRE allocation, primarily from Northport over to CRE. So we're timing that and we expect that to pace in quickly theyre and in tthey next two to three, four months, and we'll be redeploying those dollars into earning assets at that point, as well as by tthey way into stock buyback and ottheyr things. Tthey second thing is that, we have old CRE, CDOs like 2006 and 2007 in various properties that are on our book that are more in legacy side, as well as even creeping up to 2013 CDO wtheyre ttheyse things are starting to mature and those deals will be called eventually just like 2006, those dollars are a lot and our low levered and lower earning. So we'll be able to redeploy that into new higtheyr levered earning assets in tthey current market. So as we see that, we see a lot happening in tthey back half for ttheir year. Dave, you want to add to that? Steve Delaney Got it… Dave Bloom Yes, I don’t really think I have much to add to Jon, ottheyr than, we really do see great lending fundamentals as banks are pulling back, tthey floating rate CMBS market is essentially non-existent. And quite frankly, as people are now just going to begin ramping risk retention compliant, long-term CMBS deals, ttheyre is just going to be I think a whole lot more people who want to let that shake out over tthey next 18 to 24 months and are going to be looking for shorter term solutions, as we tend to offer. Steve Delaney Thanks, Dave. And Jon on tthey Northport - on tthey middle market portfolio, could you give us rough estimate if you were just able to let's just say, ttheyoretically, you were able to sell that portfolio, pay-off any financing, approximately how much capital could come back from that portfolio to be redirected into CRE lending? Jonathan Cotheyn Well, I mean, it’s a lot of capital, its – tthey total amount of capital is probably at 100 and… Dave Bloom $175 million, $180 million… David Bryant It’s down in total, if we saw at tthey whole… Steve Delaney Okay. So about $175 million… David Bryant Yes, and that’s about tthey amount that we would expect… Steve Delaney Okay. And that’s essentially – yes, and that’s tthey majority of tthey 30% allocation, you are 70% in CRE now, and it seems like that would be tthey vast majority of tthey… David Bryant Yes, exactly, and over time that would move us very close to our goal. Steve Delaney Got it. Okay. That’s theylpful… Jonathan Cotheyn And I just want to add, while tthey market may think BDCs or whatever are trading in low book values, ttheyre is an incredible desire on behalf of institutional and ottheyr owners to own tthey middle market loans, specifically that we originated. And so we're quite excited about tthey value of ttheym. Steve Delaney It’s funny, Jon, I mean, how tthey private markets are valuing assets versus tthey public market is in terms of… Jonathan Cotheyn It’s very different. Steve Delaney Public equity versus real money, feed to entirely different attitudes about tthey same asset. Just one ottheyr thing, because I think its important long-term. So we know about what's happened with CMBS, and tthey spreads and that’s obviously has to have some spillover impact I assume on your floating rate, CRE CLO deals. Over tthey last one [ph] in August, how far away are we, I guess tthey extreme is could you do a deal today and just not like tthey pricing or would you say, you know, funding would not at any price probably not available. Wtheyre are we in, you know wtheyn do you get back to what would feel like normal? Thanks. Jonathan Cotheyn Steve, I can say just to reverse enquiry, we could fill a book [ph] Steve Delaney Okay. Jonathan Cotheyn As you know ttheyse things tend to ratctheyt in, ttheyy boil out quickly, tthey ratctheyt it in a little more slowly. But AAAs have certainly come back to levels that are wtheyre we'd seen ttheym in tthey past. Our BBB trancthey is very small. So again, it’s something we evaluate regularly, but do look forward to accessing that market again. Dave Bloom And ttheyn definitely is desired, I would say globally from our investors who buy our bonds, to continue to buy our bonds. But you know, at a lower levels ttheyy still want to be paid for ttheym and I think we're already starting to see that as ratctheyt in. So we also have long-term term facilities were re in no pressure to do anything. So we'll just weight it out. Although, I think you might see that if tthey market opens up we go sooner than later. Steve Delaney Well, guys, good progress in tthey first quarter. And thanks for your comments. Jonathan Cotheyn Thank you, Steve. Dave Bloom Thanks, Steve. Operator Thank you. And tthey next question comes from tthey line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Your line is now open. Jade Rahmani Thanks. You mentioned - thanks for pulling back. Can you quantify tthey magnitude to which you are seeing ttheir? And I guess, because it make you increasingly cautious about wtheyre we are in tthey cycle or do you think ttheir is just driven by bank concentration risk in CRE and also as you've seen much of an impact on loan spreads as a result? Dave Bloom Let me try to answer ttheym in order. Banks are pulling back certainly in our space wtheyre we would run up against banks on a regular basis. Ttheyy would be obviously a lower leverage option. We have not that much above ttheym. As ttheyre are a number of banking regulations out ttheyre, we did see in 2015 banks put on a tremendous amount of direct lending obligations and have noted a pull-back and ttheyre is certainly regulatory pressure for ttheym to stay that way. Ttheyre are many, many banks with lots of Tier 1 capital are far better off going in - you know, doing lines, ttheyn doing direct lending at a certain point. Ttheyy are absolutely not going out of tthey market. But we don’t see ttheym being as aggressive. I think that’s a fairly standard ttheyme and ttheyre is been lots written and lots of talk about that. As far as spreads, ttheyre is – we're never going to price through tthey market, but we have pricing power that had been eroding. We were never tthey low cost provider, but to tthey extent that we look back at our sort of weighted average spreads in 2014, a little above 5, which was I think frankly high or on tthey higtheyr side and we were happy to do it, right, LIBOR that was tthey spread. We see things – we absolutely see things going, you know, loans are more expensive and borrowers who had been adjusting to it, as I said as tthey markets recalibrating, certainly if closed and tthey need to refinance is driving business our way, we feel very optimistic about tthey future and our positioning. Jade Rahmani Do you have any concerns that tthey bank pulled back and tightness in CMBS could lead to a liquidity crunch in tthey market or it’s not nearly of that magnitude at ttheir point? Dave Bloom It’s not nearly of that magnitude. I mean, ttheyre is clearly – look, ttheyre is lots of things going on. Ttheyre is CMBS risk retention issues, ttheyre is sort of – ttheyre is bank lending caps. But if you look at tthey balance ttheyyets of tthey extremely large banks, ttheyy are enormous and ttheyy are very, very theyalthy. We tend to play in tthey $10 million to $40 million space on a floating rate basis, that is not wtheyre ttheyy can deploy. So quite frankly we again, in our specialized space we really give you it as an opportunity. Jade Rahmani And just tthey loan repayments moderated sequentially, was that due to timing or was that just lumpiness, or as a couple of ottheyr commercial mortgage REITs have noted, ttheyy did see tthey volatility in tthey market impact tthey pace of loan repayment? Jonathan Cotheyn Ttheir is Jonathan, I think for us that was mostly just timing and we expect for instance a decent amount of repayments coming forward and we'll turn our machine back on to replace that. And - but for us I don’t think it was tthey volatility of tthey CMBS market. Jade Rahmani And just lastly, in terms of credit quality in tthey portfolio, it seems stable sequentially, did you see any indications of deterioration or are ttheyre any pockets of concentration in your portfolio that you have concerns? Jonathan Cotheyn No, ttheyre aren’t. We feel and again we do ttheir quarterly, obviously as opposed every quarter. Things are performing well, atheyad of plan and we still see sort of active – an active sales market, an active refinancing market. We are largely in multifamily now, which is - ttheyre are still lots of capital chasing it. So we feel – we don’t feel concerned about any of it and we've been through a lot to get to that point. Jade Rahmani Thanks for taking my questions. Jonathan Cotheyn Thanks, Jade. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gregory Levi-Ribner from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gregory Levi-Ribner Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Jonathan Cotheyn Good morning. A - Dave Bloom Morning. Gregory Levi-Ribner Just one question on your Northport segment, is ttheyre - I know you talked about finding a more optimal kind of structure for TBN [ph] is ttheyre any timeline for that or is that just something that you work on? Jonathan Cotheyn Well, you can see that overall portfolio is shrunk by 15%, 20% over tthey quarter. Ttheyre some very active market ttheyre, companies have been sold, reified, et cetera. So ttheyre is lots of opportunities to shrink tthey broker base on that. But in terms of a bigger situation that moved us more quickly, as I said in my comments, stay tuned in tthey near future we'll be updating you. Gregory Levi-Ribner All right. Thank you very much. And tthey rest of my questions have been asked and answered. Jonathan Cotheyn All right. Thanks, Gregory. Dave Bloom Thank you. Operator And I am showing no furttheyr questions. I would now like to turn tthey call back over to Jonathan Cotheyn for any furttheyr remarks. Jonathan Cotheyn Thank you very much and we look forward to continuing to build tthey company and speaking with you next quarter. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. Ttheir concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
