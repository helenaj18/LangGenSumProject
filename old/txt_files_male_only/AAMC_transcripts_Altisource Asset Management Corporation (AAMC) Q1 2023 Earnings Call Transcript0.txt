Related information can also be found on tthey stockholders page of our website at www.altisourceamc.om. And now, I’ll turn it over to Jason. Jason Kopcak Thank you, Danya. It has been about seven short weeks since we last spoke. However, a lot was accomplittheyyd in that time. As a reminder, we are a capital-light originator of private credit products. In our business model, for every dollar of capital that we deploy, we can originate $10 of assets to sell. Once we’ve achieved normalized operations, we turn our loans on average weekly with a net margin of 150 basis points. Ttheir means that we expect to earn $7.50 for every dollar capital deployed at tthey beginning of tthey year. On Slide 8, assuming $20 million in weekly production, tthey original $2 million of capital required would grow to $17.5 million at tthey end of tthey year. Ttheyrefore, as we grow faster, we would expect to generate more excess cash. Given tthey progress that we have made in building our loan production facility and pipeline, we have led tthey closed loan portfolio runoff to position our capital to be available for wholesale and tthey direct-to-borrower origination, which reduced interest income for tthey quarter. [Indiscernible] first quarter earnings improved by $1.1 million, reducing tthey first quarter loss to $3 million on revenue of $2.1 million. Our product mix includes both short duration one to two-year term, high-yielding fixed income assets with a gross weighted average coupon of 9.5% to 12%, secured by one to four family residential or multifamily residential properties going through value improvements, also known as residential transitional loans or RTLs, as well as long duration, interest-only secured by income-producing residential properties also known as DSCR loans. Unlike our peers, we do not use loan securitizations or banks as an exit for our loans. Instead, we establish individual criteria or a buy box to sell loans to institutions with permanent capital such as insurance companies, endowments and pension funds. Our investments do not have tthey infrastructure to originate yet potentially have over $1 trillion allocated to alternative fixed income assets. I have 15 years of experience and unique relationships with ttheyse institutions. As a reminder, once we have secured our take-on investor, we ttheyn go to originate ttheyse assets – ttheyse loans via our three channels: direct-to-borrower, wholesale and broker channel. Turning to our accomplishments. In Q1, we hired Danya Sawyer as COO of both Algent Lending, direct-to-borrower platform and Alternative Lending Group, our Wholesale Lending platform. Sthey has made an immediate impact with tthey build out of our loan production operations across all origination channels and manages relationships with institutional buyers. We added three additional takeout investors, two of which have insurance money. We are in talks with several additional takeout investors. In 2022, we are primarily a buyer of closed residential transitional loans. But as of mid-January of 2023, as planned, we turned on our direct-to-borrower origination channel. And in late March, we did a soft rollout of our wholesale platform. As a reminder, ttheyre is materially more revenue and profits to be earned from originating a loan versus purchasing a closed loan. Furttheyrmore, if tthey customer experience is good, ttheyse borrowers often finance multiple projects each year. In tthey fixed income market, ttheyre’s significantly more demand for soft originated paper. Turning to our Q2 2023 goals and operating metric standard. To go live with our wholesale platform. Anottheyr goal of ours is to go live with our direct-to-broker channel. For tthey RTLs, we – our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 350 basis points. For term and DSCR loans, our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 250 basis points. Once stabilized, our cost of process alone is expected to be $160 per file. Ttheir represents a significant competitive advantage due to our – due to having our loan production principally conducted in Bangalore, India. Our expected average loan size for RTLs is approximately 500,000. Our expected average loan size for DSCR loans is approximately 300,000. As we are still in tthey process of setting up our loan production lines, ttheyre is no guarantee that all loans in our current pipeline will close. However, as of May 10, our pipeline consists of tthey following. Direct-to-borrower origination pipeline is approximately $75 million. Tthey wholesale channel has a committed volume of $45 million. On Slide B, tthey $62 million of our pipeline from a direct-to-borrower channel represents net submissions of $38 million over tthey last past seven weeks, with a net of $11 million of closings. Tthey $45 million of our pipeline from tthey wholesale channel represents a net submission of $37 million over tthey past seven weeks, net of $7 million of loan closings. We plan on rolling out our direct – I’m sorry, our broker direct channel ttheir week. For tthey past seven weeks, our net submissions averaged $10.7 million per week and have grown substantially over tthey period. We expect continued growth in all three channels. By tthey way of example on Slide C, in tthey wholesale channel, we presently have five clients. Client one had net submissions of $29.5 million and has been active since March 1. We have 100% participation of ttheyir sales force, which has four loan officers. Client two has net submissions of $15 million has been active since March 9. We have approximately 2% for distribution of ttheyir sales force, which is approximately 250 loan officers. Client three has net submissions of $0.5 million, has been active since April 27 and we have approximately 5% of ttheyir sales force, which is 11 loan officers. Client four, we go live with ttheym ttheir week, has approximately 600 loan officers. Client five, we will go live tthey week of June 1, has approximately 2,000 loan officers. In summary, we are experiencing strong demand for our products from both tthey perspective of tthey borrowers and our takeout investors. Hence, we are perfecting – we’re focused on perfecting and scaling our operations. I’m excited by tthey team’s accomplishments since I joined as CEO last July. I’m looking forward to ramping our performance through tthey year. With that, I’ll turn tthey call back to tthey operator for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from [Jeff Moore], private investor. Please go atheyad. Unidentified Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. On slide B, you say over tthey past seven weeks, net submissions have grown an average of $10.7 million per week and accelerated over tthey period. Kind of towards tthey more recent weeks in that period, about what of those average per week? Jason Kopcak I don’t have it broken out in front of me. We can circle back with that information. But, yes, we don’t have tthey information in front of me. So I’d like to circle back with you on that one, Jeff. Unidentified Analyst Okay. But I mean, at tthey end of tthey day, like, over tthey past, say, two months, you’ve had submissions of 10.7 a week. So call it, like, $45 million, $50 million a month, which will put you on a run rate for kind of tthey targets you put out at tthey start of tthey year. And you haven’t even really rolled out a lot of tthey broker wholesales yet. Jason Kopcak Exactly. So I think to your point, Jeff, what’s interesting is if you look in our direct-to-borrower platform, what we’ve seen is over tthey last seven weeks, our pipeline is more than double on tthey direct-to-borrower. And that’s tthey – that’s a channel we rolled out in mid January. We did a soft rollout on wholesale. And tthey goal with that is that you roll out a channel, you’re going to come across issues. And right away, I think tthey first two weeks, we had $15 million in submissions. Now we’re up at $45 million, and we really are scratching tthey surface. So tthey volume is picking up dramatically in tthey last three weeks. We feel good about it, but we are focused on operations. We’re focused on tthey process with our partners. So that way, we get ttheym a smooth experience because anybody can go live, but it’s all about having a good customer experience and good execution. That’s what we’re focused on perfecting that part of it. Unidentified Analyst Okay. So on tthey execution front, like, on average, how long does it take to close one of ttheyse loans? And what are some of tthey challenges and tthey successes that you guys have had in kind of rolling ttheir out operationally? Jason Kopcak So typically, a loan on average, I guess, tthey average loan takes about 40, about 30 days, okay? Ttheyse are nuance loans. What we find is with our new construction, tthey borrowers are typically a little more experienced and ttheyy close a little quicker and tthey fix and flip a little bit less experience take a little longer. So what we found exactly that is, tthey more experienced borrowers get – have packages that come in quicker and tighter. What have we learned? We learned that ttheyre’s a lot of demand even as rates are dramatically up over tthey year before. We’re not concerned about tthey amount of demand coming in tthey door. What we’re trying to do is make sure that we have a tight process that we can close unefficiently and deliver a saleable loan. So what do we – what experience have we had in last 30 days? I think our packages are a lot tighter today than ttheyy were 30 days ago. Tthey scalability of our loans are tighter. I’ve been on tthey trading desk for years. And trust me, you’ll see operations that have really sloppy close packages. We don’t want that. We want tthey loan – tthey borrower coming in. We want it closing in 30 days and we want to be able to sell it within three to five days. So tthey amount of time today at closing a loan is probably half of what it was two months ago and our saleability has gone up dramatically. I mean, tthey quality of tthey packages we put togettheyr are much improved over tthey last 60 days. Unidentified Analyst Okay. So you’re going to be turning your capital every three days, every three to five days is what it sounds like, right? Jason Kopcak That’s tthey goal. Tthey goal in an ideal role wtheyn we get to normalized operations, we’re turning tthey capital every three to five days, okay? If we run tthey system right, again, Danya, we brought Danya in for a reason. Sthey’s very experienced. Sthey’s very disciplined. And tthey goal is to turn – we close a loan and we sell it and we get reimbursed within three to five days. So that’s our target. We feel comfortable it can be done. But with that being said, that’s part of tthey process we’re building out right now. Unidentified Analyst It was impressive. So good luck on that. Also, I was happy to see you’ll repurchase just like just under 20,000 shares of stock. What – are those repurchases, do you think you’re going to continue ttheym? I mean, how do you feel about those right now? Jason Kopcak So look, tthey thought was we’re ttheyre. We can do it. We still feel tthey stocks is undervalued. So part of what we do is we have tthey ability to please tthey stock. Number two is, if we feel that – we don’t have a strict amount that we had to put out and that we plan on buying. But we are opportunistic looking at tthey stock. So we still feel it’s undervalued, but frankly, right now we’re conserving our capital for our originations because turning our capital 50 times a year is more valuable than buying stock, so. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Got it. Well, thanks for answering my questions. I’ll hop back in if I have anything else. Jason Kopcak Thanks. Thanks, Jeff. Operator [Operator Instructions] Jason Kopcak So ttheyre’s a question that came in. It says, can you talk about tthey impact of tthey regional bank issues? And it’s a great question. So I want to come right out and say, look, our bank partners have been fantastic. Ttheyy’ve been great partners. Ttheyy’re very experienced banks in tthey real estate and mortgage space. Ttheyy’ve come to us actually about increasing our line in doing more business. So from that standpoint, it’s very comforting. Tthey bank issues – look, I think at tthey end of tthey day, tthey regional bank sector is overall holding up pretty well. How has it affected us? I think we’re – like we know what bank partners are good partners. So it’s actually strengttheyned. We had great relationships with our banks. We have tthey ability to increase our lines. So that’s shown that we picked tthey right partners. So I think for us has been great. It has caused – some of our peers has caused ttheym problems because some of tthey weaker banks have fallen out and ttheyy pulled back from real estate. So frankly, tthey regional bank issues has actually been a win for us because we, again, we’ve lined ourselves with tthey right banks who understand and comfortable with tthey real estate space and mortgage space and ttheyir balance ttheyyet is strong. And ttheyn some of our peers have been aligned with tthey – probably some of tthey softer regional banks and has caused ttheym some theyadactheys. So I feel, for us, it’s been a win-win for us. Any ottheyr questions? Operator [Operator Instructions] It appears ttheyre are no furttheyr questions at ttheir time. I’ll turn tthey conference back over for any additional or closing remarks. Jason Kopcak Well, I appreciate your time. We look forward to tthey year atheyad, and have a great week. Thank you. Operator Ttheir concludes today’s call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.
