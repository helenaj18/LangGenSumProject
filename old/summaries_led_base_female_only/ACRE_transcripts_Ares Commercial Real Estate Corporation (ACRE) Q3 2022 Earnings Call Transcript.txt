 we report third quarter distributable earnings of $21.3 million or $0.39 per share, an increase of 5% from the third quarter of last year, which exceeded our quarterly regular and supplemental dividends paid of $0.35 per share. our distributable earnings were supported by the benefits of rising interest rates and some modest prepayment fees received. during the third quarter, we closed $50 million of floating rate investments across multifamily and self-storage properties and $28 million of newly issued AAA-rated, newly liquid debt securities across both public and private markets. 
 we also took advantage of what we believe are compelling opportunities in the CMBS markets by purchasing $28 million of newly issued AAA-rated CRE securities, backed by a pool of senior floating rate mortgages. 
 we believe these securities are highly attractive investments with weighted average credit spreads of 245 basis points, resulting in unlevered yields today in excess of 6% at current SOFR rates, all backed by a diversified pool of underlying commercial real estate properties with lTVs of 30% to 40%. despite the slower market, we had $167 million of repayments during the third quarter, which included a $30 million hospitality loan with a risk rated four loan one year
