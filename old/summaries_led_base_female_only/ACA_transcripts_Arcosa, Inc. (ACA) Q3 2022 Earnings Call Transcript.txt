 we report strong results in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, driven by strong growth in our infrastructure driven businesses, particularly construction products and utility structures, while effectively managing the cyclicality in our wind barge and rail component businesses. 
 we ended the quarter slightly below our long-term leverage target and we further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position in the third quarter with the completion of the storage tank divestiture. 
 we now anticipate 15% adjusted EBITDA growth in the midpoint of our guidance range for 2022.
