 we report on our second quarter 2023 financial results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. 
 our second quarter revenue was in line with our expectations, while our non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP loss per share were better than our expectations. our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.21, above our balanced range of a loss of $0.23 to $0.31. during the second quarter, 66% of our revenue was from our data center products. 22% was from our CATV products, with the remaining 11% from FTTH, telecom and other. in the second quarter, 75% of our revenue was from our 100-gig products, 12% was from our 200-gig and 400-gig products and 5% was from our 40-gig products. 
 we are encouraged by the increased demand we saw for our 100- and 400-gig products in our datacenter business during the second quarter.
