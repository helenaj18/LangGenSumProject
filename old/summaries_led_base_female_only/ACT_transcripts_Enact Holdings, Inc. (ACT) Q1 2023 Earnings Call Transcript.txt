 we report strong results for the first quarter of 2023 with a 17% return on equity and net income of $176 million or $1.08 per diluted share, which was up 7% year-over-year. Insurance in-force in the quarter was a record $253 billion, driven by persistency of 85% and new insurance written of $13 billion as we continued to win new business. net premiums earned were $235 million, up 1% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year in net premiums, driven by strong growth of older policies as well as strong growth of new policies as well as higher lapse income. 
 the average weighted average credit score in our portfolio was 7.44%, down 0.5 basis points sequentially and down 1.8 basis points year-over-year. with elevated interest rates, persistency remained high at 85% in the first quarter of 2023, relatively flat sequentially and up 9 percentage points year-over-year. we continue to book new delinquencies in an approximate 10% claim rate, reflecting our prudent and measured approach to reserving as a result of heightened economic uncertainty. 
 our claim rate in the quarter was negative 5%, which reflected a reserve release of $70 million, driven by ever-to-date home price appreciation, our approach to risk management and loss mitigation, and the favorable resolution of long-term forbearance plans. 
 we also executed a reinsurance transaction as part of our credit risk transfer program, which secured excess of loss coverage from a panel of highly rated reinsurers covering our new insurance written throughout 2023 and providing up to $180 million of reinsurance coverage on our 2023 book year. 
 we believe this transaction serves as another proof point to the value of diversified capital sources, which allowed us the secured coverage on attractive terms, despite volatility in other parts of the market. 
 we continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility with a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility to adapt to market conditions.
