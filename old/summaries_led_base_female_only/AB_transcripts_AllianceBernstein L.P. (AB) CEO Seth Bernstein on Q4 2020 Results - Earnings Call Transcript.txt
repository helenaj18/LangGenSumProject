 we report on our fourth quarter and full year financial results and discuss our strategy for the future.  
 we generated net inflows of 5.7 billion in the fourth quarter and 9.2 billion in the full year, reflecting strong growth in institutional offset by net outflows in retail and private wealth.  for the full year, we generated net inflows of 9.2 billion and net outflows of 4.6 billion, reflecting strong growth in both active equities and active fixed income.    
 our fourth quarter active organic growth of 3% was offset by lower year-over-year portfolio fee rates.    
 our full year active organic growth of 30.1% was up 260 basis points year-over-year.    
 we delivered 15% growth in both earnings and distributions to unitholders.    
 our long-term investment performance remained solid with our talented teams continuing to generate idiosyncratic returns that can't be replicated.    
 we also continue to build our suite of higher fee alternatives, including entry into both the CLO market and the European Commercial Real Estate Debt market.    
 we continue to enjoy invaluable support from Equitable for
