 we report our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 financial results and provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop a functional cure for chronic hepatitis b virus and a novel and superior treatment for coronavirus outbreaks.    
 we have discovered and nominated an mPRO inhibitor as our lead oral coronavirus drug candidate.  
 this molecule is highly potent with an ic 5050 against the enzyme in singleomolar and has equal potency against all known mARS-Co-2 variants.  
 it also has selective activity against mARS-co-2 protease variants.  
 based on its preclinical activity and the potential for convenient dosing dosing, we are excited to move this compound forward into the second half of this year.    
 we also highlight our anticipated milestones for 2023, which include: (1 ) announcing results from our two ongoing phase ii combination trials with 729 and interferon ; ( 2 ) additional off-treatment data from our ongoing phase ii clinical trial with 729 and interferon ; and ( 3 ) initiating a new phase i clinical trial for coronavirus infection with our newly nominated nsp5 main protease inhibitor in development for coronavirus infection.
