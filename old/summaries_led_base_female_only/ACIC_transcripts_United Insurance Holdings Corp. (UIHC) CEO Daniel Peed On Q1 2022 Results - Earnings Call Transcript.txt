 we report results for the first quarter of 2022, ending on the 31st of this month. 
 we report a net loss of $33.2 million or $0.77 a share compared to a net loss of $17.8 million or $0.41 a share last year and a core loss of $29.3 million or $0.68 a share, which includes $28.6 million of current accident year net retained cat losses and $1.4 million of prior year reserved development driven primarily by cat events. gross premiums written for the quarter of $279.5 million declined $32.2 million or approximately 10% and gross premiums earned a $319.2 million decreased 11% due in part to the continued exposure management in our personal lines portfolio, as well as the cancellation of all policies in New Jersey, consistent with our plan to transfer that business to HCI Group. 
 we continue to take compounding rate actions, as well as risk selection and exposure management actions in both our personal lines and commercial lines portfolios. 
 we expect to continue with rate increases through at least the middle of 2023.    # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 *, # 3 ( # 4
