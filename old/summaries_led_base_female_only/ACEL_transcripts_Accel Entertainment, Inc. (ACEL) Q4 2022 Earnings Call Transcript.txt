 we report record revenue of $278 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $43 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 45% and 30%, respectively.  for the full year, we set a new record with total revenue of $970 million and adjusted EBITDA of $162 million, year-over-year increases of 32% and 16%, respectively.  this strong performance is primarily due to the successful acquisition of Century as well as our growth in Illinois, where we added 52 locations and saw same-store sales grow 6% year-over-year.  in our developing markets, we continue to invest and remain optimistic about their long-term potential.  on the expense side, we are continuing to adjust to the new normal, where we saw inflation and other macroeconomic factors increase many of our large expenses such as labor, parts and fuel.  our asset-light business model and highly variable cost structure allows us to quickly calibrate our business to the current environment.  we also continue to invest in new technologies to streamline our operations while always maintaining our reputation for the best-in-class service.  we also continue to look for new opportunities across the country, and we are evaluating multiple opportunities across the country.
