 we report first quarter results and discuss our strategy for the second half of the year and beyond. 
 our first quarter sales rose 7% as a result of the acquisition of the leading player in video gaming accessories such as controllers, power charging stations, and headphones, that we bought in late December 2020. Comparable sales declined approximately 13% in the first quarter of this year. 
 we expect growth in the second quarter due to the impact of the back-to-school season in the first quarter of this year and the expected recovery in the second half of this year. 
 we also expect growth in the second half of the year due to our cost reduction efforts and higher profits in the second quarter of this year. 
 we expect our free cash flow for this year to be at least $135 million. 
 we expect to use the majority of our free cash flow this year to reduce debt and to reduce our year-end leverage ratio to approximately 3.5 times, which is where it was prior to the acquisition of PowerA.
