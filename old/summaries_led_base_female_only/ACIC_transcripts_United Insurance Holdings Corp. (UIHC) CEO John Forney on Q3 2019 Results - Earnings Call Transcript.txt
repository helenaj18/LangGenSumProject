 this is a transcript of the third quarter 2019 results conference call for the company and its subsidiary, United Insurance Holdings Corporation (UIHC ). 
 the company reported a loss of $58.2 million or $1.05 a share from all accident years in the third quarter of 2019 and a combined ratio of 24.9% or $0.68 a share. 
 cat losses of $58.2 million were the driver of results for this quarter adding over 30 points to the combined ratio adding over 30 points to the underlying combined ratio year over year. $1.05 per share in after-tax cat losses obviously ruined our quarter and understandably, that's the headline. But for us, the storyline is a more conservative cat-reserving posture, continued strong organic growth in both personal and commercial lines and improvement in underlying results as the cumulative effect of rate increases, claims handling and underwriting initiatives takes hold in our book.
