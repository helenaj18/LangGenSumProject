 the Joyceâ€™s Company, Inc. (NYSE:AAN ) reported second quarter earnings for the second quarter of 2023 that were ahead of internal expectations, driven in part by our ongoing focus on cost controls. we also benefited from a healthier lease portfolio resulting from optimization of our lease decisioning model in prior quarters. These items contributed significantly to our strong bottomline performance in the second quarter, offsetting continued challenging customer demand trends. in the second quarter, we ended the quarter with a larger-than-expected lease portfolio size of $119.6 million. 
 we expect continued demand challenges in the back half of the year, but we expect to see sequential improvements as we lap some numbers in the back half of last year. 
 we also updated our outlook for the consolidated company and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year, but maintained our adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS outlook. 
 we also increased our adjusted free cash flow outlook for the year.
