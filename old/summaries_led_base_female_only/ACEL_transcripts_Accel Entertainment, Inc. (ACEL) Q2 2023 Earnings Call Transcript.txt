 we report second quarter revenue of $293 million and adjusted EBITDA of $47 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% and 9% respectively. 
 the revenue growth was primarily driven by the successful acquisition of Century and 0.4% same store sales growth in Illinois. our cost structure continues to remain stable despite the inflationary impacts on labor and costs. on the expense side, our technology investments have started to bear fruit and we continue to see a gradual improvement in the revenues. 
 we also continue to see some signs of stabilization in the labor market, allowing us to better retain and attract talent. on the greenfield front, we continue to look for new opportunities outside of Illinois. 
 we are currently evaluating multiple opportunities across the country and our goal continues to be to generate a percentage of revenue generated outside of Illinois.
