 Arlington Asset Investment Corporation (AI ) reported a net loss of $0.13 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which includes a $0.23 per share of a deferred tax provision resulting in pre-tax income of $0.10 per share. Non-GAAP core operating income was $0.59 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share from the prior quarter. Core operating income compared to the prior quarter was impacted primarily by favorable funding dynamics of repo financing hedged with interest rate swaps, modestly higher asset yields from reinvestments at current higher yields and lower G&A expenses for the quarter, partially offset by higher fixed pay rates on interest rate swaps and slightly lower investment volumes.
