 we report strong organic sales growth of 35% on an organic basis in the second quarter of 2019, driven by double-digit growth across all four of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals, nutrition and medical devices. excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year.  our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%.  we continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021.  our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months.
