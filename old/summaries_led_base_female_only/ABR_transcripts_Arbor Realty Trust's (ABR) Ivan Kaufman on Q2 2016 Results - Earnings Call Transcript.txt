 we report on our second quarter financial results and discuss the acquisition of our manager’s agency business which we believe will be transformational for our platform and most importantly very rewarding for our shareholders. 
 we had a very strong second quarter generating a net income of $12 million or $0.23 per share excluding depreciation expense, non-cash stock compensation expense and $750,000 of expenses incurred during the quarter related to the acquisition of our manager’s agency platform. 
 this transaction includes a significant servicing portfolio as an estimated fair value of approximately $225 million which will generate a significant predictable annuity of income going forward in excess of $55 million, annually. we also continue to produce impressive results from the investments we have made in the residential mortgage banking business in 2015. 
 our second quarter originations had an average yield of approximately 7.3% and we generated levered returns in excess of 14% on these investments. 
 we also recorded approximately $1.9 million of income related to residual fees that were due to us from a discounted note we acquired and settled back in the second quarter of last year, $2.5 million was recorded in other interest income and $600,000 was recorded in compensation expense related to this
