 we report results for the first quarter of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our first quarter net sales increased 11% to $442 million and adjusted net income was $10 million, which was higher than our expectations and included both price and volume growth. Earnings per share were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 the 11% comparable sales growth for our total business was higher than our expectations and included both price increases and volume growth. 
 the 11% total company comparable sales growth is especially impressive as we delivered it despite a decline in PowerA sales. 
 our international segment posted 23% comparable sales growth driven by a strong back-to-school season in Latin America and a rebound in Mexico and Brazil. 
 our international segment also doubled its adjusted operating income due to strong sales in the release of prior year reserves. Adjusted operating income was $23 million compared with $25 million last year. EMEA operating margin declined as our pricing has not yet caught up with inflationary cost increases.
