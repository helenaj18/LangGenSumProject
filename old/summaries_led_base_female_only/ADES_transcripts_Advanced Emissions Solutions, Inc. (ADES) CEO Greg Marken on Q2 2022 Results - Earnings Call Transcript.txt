 we report results for the second quarter and first half of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our second quarter revenues and cost of revenues were $24.7 million and $19.9 million, respectively, which reflect year-over-year growth in excess of 41% for the second consecutive quarter. our gross margin also improved to 19.5% compared to 15.4% in the prior year. our bottom line performance was slightly below breakeven as we reported a net loss of $0.3 million compared to net income of $16.6 million in 2021. our consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.2 million compared to $21.2 million in the prior year. Keep in mind that the year-over-year variance is primarily a function of equity earnings from our investments in Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services in the prior year. our second quarter production volume exceeded expectations, which is important to note since our second quarter is traditionally seasonally slower and thus is an important inventory-building period. 
 this has allowed us to increase our inventory position in advance of moving into the warmer summer months of our seasonally strong third quarter. 
 we continue to see strong customer interest in our activated carbon
