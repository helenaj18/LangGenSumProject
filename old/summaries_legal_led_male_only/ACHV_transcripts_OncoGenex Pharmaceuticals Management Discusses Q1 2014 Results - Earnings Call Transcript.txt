OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals (OGXI) today announced that it has restated its financial results for the first quarter of 2014.  The company's CEO, Scott Cormack, and CFO, Filippo Petti, announced the results of an ongoing clinical trial that is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cytotoxic treatments for advanced bladder cancer.  The company also announced that it has signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. that will allow it to expedite clinical trials of cytotoxic treatments for bladder cancer.  According to the company's press release, on April 30, 2014, the company announced top line survival results in its Phase III trial of apatorsen in second-line prostate cancer.  The company's first quarter 2014 financial results, which were released on April 30, 2014, showed that the addition of custirsen to standard first-line dose attacks on prednisone did not significantly improve overall survival.  The company's first quarter 2014 net loss was $19.7 million compared with $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.  The company's second quarter 2014 net loss included a noncash loss on revaluation of our warrant liability of $721,000, and a noncash gain of $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2014.  In addition, the company's first quarter 2014 net loss for the first quarter of 2014 included a noncash loss on the addition of custirsen.  The company's second quarter 2014 financial results, which were announced earlier this week, showed that custirsen did not significantly improve overall survival in patients with advanced bladder cancer.  The company's third quarter 2014 net loss for the first quarter was $19.7 million, compared with $13.4 million in the same period in 2013.  The company's first quarter 2014 net income for the first quarter of 2014 was $8.6 million or $0.59 per diluted common share.  The company's second quarter 2014 net income for the first quarter was $11.7 million, compared with $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2013.  In addition, the company's second quarter 2014 net loss for the first quarter of 2013 was $1.4 million.  The company's third quarter 2014 net income was $11.7 million.  The company's first quarter 2014 financial result for the second half of 2014 was unexpected, given the large amount of preclinical and clinical evidence confirming custirsen's ability to suppress the cancer-protective protein, clusterin, and for long overall survival in patients with advanced bladder cancer.
