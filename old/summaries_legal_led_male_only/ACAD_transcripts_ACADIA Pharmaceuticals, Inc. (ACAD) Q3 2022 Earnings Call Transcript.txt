On November 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that it has approved a new drug to treat schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, the drug was not approved for use in the U.S. for schizophrenia.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the SEC's Eastern District of New York, alleges that the drug was not approved for use in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.  The complaint further alleges that the drug was not approved in the U.S. for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that the drug did not work as well as previously thought.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court, charges that the drug was not approved for use in patients with schizophrenia.  The SEC's complaint charges that the drug violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the complaint charges that the drug violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brendan Teehan and supervised by Marc Goodman and Yatin Suneja of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Teehan and Ms. Suneja.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
