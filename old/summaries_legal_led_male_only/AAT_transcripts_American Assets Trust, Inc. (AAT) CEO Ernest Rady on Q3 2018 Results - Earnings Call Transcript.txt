On October 31, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that American Assets Trust, Inc. ("AAT"), a San Diego-based real estate investment trust, announced positive third quarter financial results.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the company's portfolio includes three properties located at the heart of the San Diego area.  The complaint alleges that, in the third quarter of 2018, the company's lease termination income increased by approximately $0.01 per square foot.  The complaint further alleges that, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the lease termination income increased by approximately $0.02 per square foot.  The complaint alleges that, in the fourth quarter, the lease termination income increased by approximately $1.3 million, which is approximately a 4% increase over the prior quarter's figure.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the higher lease termination income, the company's lease termination income increased by $0.01 per square foot.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Carroll and Mark Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Carroll and Mr. Rymas.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
