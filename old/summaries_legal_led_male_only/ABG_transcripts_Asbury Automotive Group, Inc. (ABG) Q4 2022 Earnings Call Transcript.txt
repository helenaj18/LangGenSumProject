The company also announced that it has agreed to pay a $1.4 billion civil penalty in the amount of $1.4 billion.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, as part of a multi-year agreement to acquire a large portfolio of automotive brands, ABG was unable to acquire any of the brands at the time of the acquisition because of supply constraints.  ABG has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.4 billion in the amount of $2.7 billion, which is approximately double the pre-tax income of ABG generated in the fourth quarter of 2017.  ABG has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1 million in the amount of $2.7 billion.  The settlement is subject to Court approval.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Hult, Daniel Imbro, and Ryan Sigdahl of the New York office.
