On May 9, 2023, the company announced positive top line results from its first-ever randomized placebo-controlled trial for nicotine e-cigarettes.  The company also announced positive top line results from its second NDA-enabling trial.  According to the company's press release announcing the results of the trial, which was conducted in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, cytisinicline was very well tolerated with 50.9% of subjects who received cytisinicline reporting adverse events compared to 54.7% of subjects in the placebo arm. Adverse events were as expected, mainly mild to moderate, and there were no serious adverse events reported during the study.  The company's Board of Directors has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued anÂ Investor AlertÂ to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an e-cigarette using the free and simple search tool onÂ Investor.gov.
