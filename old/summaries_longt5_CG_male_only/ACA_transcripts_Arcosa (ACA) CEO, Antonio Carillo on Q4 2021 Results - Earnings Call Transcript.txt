the arcosa industry is a global global health organization that is a major global health problem. we have experienced a significant growth in our growth businesses and engineered structures. we have grown our construction products platform both organically and through two natural aggregates-led acquisitions. we anticipate growth growth in our growth businesses, including construction products and engineered structures, and expect growth growth in our growth businesses to be a headwind in 2022. we anticipate increase in adjusted ebitd for our growth businesses, and we anticipate double-digit increase in adjusted ebitd for our portfolio of growth businesses. partially offsetting this, we continue to see weakness in our cyclical businesses with wind tower and transportation products ; however, we are seeing early indications of improvement for these businesses and when the recovery starts, we believe there will be pent-up demand that will have to be fulfilled. at the same time, the recovery in these businesses will likely start having a positive impact in 2023. in the short term, we will be focusing on completing the integration of our recent acquisitions prioritizing strategic investments to leverage our expanded platforms and simplifying the portfolio to reduce the complexity of arcosa.
