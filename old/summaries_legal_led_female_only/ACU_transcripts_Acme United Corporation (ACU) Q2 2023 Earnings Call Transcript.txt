On July 20, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Acme United Corp. ("AUM") announced that it would be reporting second quarter earnings on July 20, 2018.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the company's inventory levels increased significantly in the second quarter of 2018.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the second quarter of 2018, Acme's inventory levels increased by approximately $9 million, which was anticipated due to inventory reductions of several of its large customers.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter of 2019, Acme's inventory levels increased by $9 million, which was anticipated because of inventory reductions of several of our large customers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Acme with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Acme has agreed to pay a $5 million civil penalty for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
