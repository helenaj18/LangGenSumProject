On June 1, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action to halt a $1.5 billion decline in the price of analog semiconductors.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the last 10 years, Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), which is one of the largest manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, has been underweight in the market for high-performance analog semiconductors.  According to the SEC's complaint, in the last 10 years, ADI has been underweight in the U.S. and Europe.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in the last 10 years, ADI was underweight in the U.S. because it was so expensive to manufacture.  The complaint further alleges that, in the last 10 years, the company was able to increase its capacity to produce high-quality, high-performance analog semiconductors.  The complaint alleges that, in the last ten years, ADI has lost its microphone.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ADI has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle the SEC's charges against it.  The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
