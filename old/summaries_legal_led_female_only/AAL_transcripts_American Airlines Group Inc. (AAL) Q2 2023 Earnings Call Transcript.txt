On July 20, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that American Airlines Group, Inc. ("AAL"), a U.S.-based airline, has agreed to pay $3.5 billion to settle a long-running accounting fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the airline's long-haul network has suffered significant declines since 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleges that American Airlines violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that American Airlines violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a) of the Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, American Airlines has agreed to settle the charges and to pay a $3.5 billion civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Vernon of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
