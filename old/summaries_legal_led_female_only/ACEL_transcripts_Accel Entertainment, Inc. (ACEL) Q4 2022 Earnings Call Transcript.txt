On February 28, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Accel Entertainment, Inc. ("Accel") announced strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal year 2022.  The company also announced a $200 million share repurchase program in November of 2021.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Accel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Accel violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Accel violated Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Accel with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Accel has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and requires Accel to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Omer Sander, Steve Pizzella, and Chad Beynon of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
