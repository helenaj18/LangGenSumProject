On February 24, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC).  The SEC's complaint alleges that Acadia Healthcare, through its former CEO, Brent Turner, misappropriated approximately $1.2 million of investor money to fund acquisitions and to pay down the company's debt.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Turner with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Turner has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $20 million.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint charges Turner with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Janice M. Duckworth with assistance from Marc Blau, and the litigation will be handled by Amy W. Baird and Carol M. Welshhans.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
