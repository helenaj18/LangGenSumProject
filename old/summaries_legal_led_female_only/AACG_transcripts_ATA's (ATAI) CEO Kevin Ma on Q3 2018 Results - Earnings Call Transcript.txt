On November 8, 2018, the Honorable Amy Tung of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in August, ATA announced that it had agreed to acquire Beijing Biztour International Travel Service Co., Ltd., a China-based education tour operator, for a total of RMB1 billion.  The complaint further alleges that, in August, ATA signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Beijing Biztour International Travel Service, for which it had previously announced a strategic investment in March.  The complaint further alleges that, with the closing of the deal in August, less applicable income taxes were not consolidated into ATA's September 30, 2018 financial statements.  The complaint further alleges that, in connection with the closing of the deal, ATA paid a special cash dividend of US$6 per ADS to shareholders in August.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges ATA with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ATA has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 10b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Danielle Prior, Marhta Huang, and Amy Tung of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Danielle Prior.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
