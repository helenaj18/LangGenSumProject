(NASDAQ:ACRS), a biopharmaceutical company based in St. Louis, Missouri, announced positive results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of its kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Aclaris violated the antifungal and antifungal registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint further alleges that Aclaris violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Aclaris with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(2) thereunder.  The complaint charges Aclaris with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Aclaris has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(3) and (4) of the Exchange Act and Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Lachlan Hanbury-Brown and Hannah Blair and supervised by Scott Frost.
