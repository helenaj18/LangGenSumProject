The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced positive top line results from a clinical trial for e-cigarettes.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy today announced the results of the trial.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education, Advocacy, and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that cytisinicline was very well tolerated with 50.9% of subjects who received cytisinicline reporting adverse events compared to 54.7% of subjects in the placebo arm.  The SEC's complaint, however, alleges that cytisinicline was not powered to do that.  According to the SEC's complaint, cytisinicline is not powered to do that.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, charges defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Christina Flaten and Grace Higgins of the Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
