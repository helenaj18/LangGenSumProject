On August 8, 2017, Craig Bram, President and CEO of Synalloy Corporation, announced the company's second quarter 2017 financial results.  According to the company's press release, the company's second quarter 2017 financial results were better than expected.  According to the SEC's press release, the company was able to wrap up entire orders in the second quarter of 2017.  According to the SEC's complaint, the company was unable to fulfill orders for its large, thick-wall pipe machine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the company's orders for the large, thick-wall pipe machine exceeded expectations.  According to the SEC's complaint, this was a result of the company's efforts to acquire the large, thick-wall pipe machine from Sweden.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges the company with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Synalloy has agreed to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Diane Gold, Craig Bram, Craig Bram, and Mike Hughes of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation will be led by Ms. Gold.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
