On November 2, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a press release announcing the successful launch of ZYNLONTA, a treatment for advanced lymphoma.  The SEC's complaint alleges that ZYNLONTA is not safe for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that ZYNLONTA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ZYNLONTA is safe and effective.  The SEC's complaint charges ZYNLONTA with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, ZYNLONTA has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer.  ZYNLONTA has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of advanced lymphoma and cancer.  The SEC is continuing to monitor ZYNLONTA's progress.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
