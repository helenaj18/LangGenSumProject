The complaint alleges that ACETO violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint further alleges that ACETO violated Rule 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and that ACETO violated Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, charges ACETO with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.
