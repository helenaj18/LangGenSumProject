 this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay for approximately one year. 
 we are participating in the fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call and webcast to review full year and fourth quarter 2019 results. 
 the company also intends to file 2019 Form 10-K with the SEC later this week. 
 we are currently operating 11 active frac fleets, of which four are the new generation electric frac fleets that went into work during the first quarter of 2020. 
 we have completed over 4,000 stages with our electric fleets in 2019 and have completed over 12,000 stages since the Clean Fleet was first introduced in 2014. 
 we believe our operational capabilities, cutting-edge technology and alignment with our customer goals of reducing completion costs while improving environmental stewardship will continue to serve as a key differentiator for us going forward.
