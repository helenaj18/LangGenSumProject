 our adjusted operating income declined by 57% to $104 million and our diluted diluted EPS declined by 63% to $0.91. 
 we continue to see significant pressure from stay-at-home workers, which led to significant reductions in both professional car counts and DIY retail traffic beginning in mid-March and impacting the remaining 6 weeks of the quarter. in terms of ticket count, we saw extreme pressure on resale of ticket counts in the quarter due to COVID-19, however our eCommerce business was strong and we saw a double-digit sales improvement year-over-year in Q1. in terms of professional performance, consistent with previous quarters, we delivered growth through mid-March, however as the quarter progressed, this segment felt extreme pressure from stay at home workers. Adjusted operating income in Q1 was $104 million, which declined 57% compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS for Q1 was $0.91, a decrease of 63%.
