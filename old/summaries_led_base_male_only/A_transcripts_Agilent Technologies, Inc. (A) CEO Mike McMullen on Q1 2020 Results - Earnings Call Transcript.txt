 we report strong growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with core revenue growth of 5.7% on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. 
 this growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions and was partially offset by a 1.5 to 3 week impact from the impact of the Coronavirus in the first quarter of our fiscal year. 
 we are also able to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the full year. 
 we are also able to translate our strong growth into strong bottomline earnings of $0.81 per share at the top end of our guidance and 7% growth at the midpoint of our guidance.
