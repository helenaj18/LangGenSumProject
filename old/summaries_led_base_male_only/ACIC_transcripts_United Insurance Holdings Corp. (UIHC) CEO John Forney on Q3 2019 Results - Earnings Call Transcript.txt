 this is a transcript of the third quarter 2019 results conference call for the company and its subsidiary, the United Insurance Holdings Corporation (UIHC ). 
 the company reported a loss of $58.2 million or $1.05 a share in the third quarter of 2019 and a combined ratio of 24.9% or $11.61 excluding unrealized gains. 
 cat losses of $58.2 million were the driver of results for this quarter adding over 30 points to the combined ratio adding over 30 points to the underlying combined ratio year over year. However, the underlying loss and combined ratios showed significant improvement compared to the same period a year ago. 
 the gross and net underlying loss ratios improved 4.3 and 7.3 points, respectively, from the third quarter of 2018, which also drove a six point improvement in the underlying combined ratio year over year. on the growth front, both personal lines and commercial lines continue to show the ability to grow at double digit annual rates even with significant rate increases in both lines. for the personal lines side, that was driven by Florida 2018, where we are still running slightly ahead of what we had estimated. And on the non-hurricane cat events side, we are seeing development patterns that have no precedent in the historical record and we are pricing and reserving for that as if it will continue and working hard on the claims handling side to try to mitigate it. So we continue to see downward trends in our non-cat loss ratios and we are working hard to manage the cat loss stuff so that we have enough rate in our book of business to handle it.
