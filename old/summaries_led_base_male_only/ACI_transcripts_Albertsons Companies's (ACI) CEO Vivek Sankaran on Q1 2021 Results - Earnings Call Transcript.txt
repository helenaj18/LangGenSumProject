 this is Vivek on behalf of the board of directors of the Albertsons Companies. 
 thanks for joining us for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. 
 we are pleased to report that our results for the quarter exceeded our internal plans across all key metrics, increasing our confidence in the balance of this year. in addition, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and adjusted net income of $518 million or $0.89 per fully diluted share, representing compound annual growth of over 70% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. on a two-year stack basis, we now expect identical sales on a two-year stack basis to be in the range of approximately 11% to 12% compared to prior guidance of 9.5% to 11%. 
 we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, which represents a two-year compounded annual growth of 47% at the midpoint of the range, up $0.25 from our prior guidance range.
