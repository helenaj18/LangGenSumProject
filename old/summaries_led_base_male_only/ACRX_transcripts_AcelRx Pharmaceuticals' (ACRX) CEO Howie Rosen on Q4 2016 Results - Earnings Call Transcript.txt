 the net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by increased operating cost and expenses.

 recently this application was accepted for filing and a PDUFA date of October 12, 2017 was assigned. for Europe we are on schedule to submit a marketing authorization application or MAA under the centralized procedure during the first half of this year.
