 during the second quarter of 2021, we reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.51 and total cash net operating income of approximately $58.7 million. 
 we also reported an increase in the dividend to its pre-COVID amount of $0.30 per share based on the continued improvement in our collections as expected. in the second quarter, we had continued success in preserving pre-COVID rental rates with 13 comparable new and renewal leases totaling approximately 50,000 rentable square feet with an over 9% increase over prior rent on a cash basis and almost 15% increase on a straight-line basis. the weighted average lease term on these leases was 3.6 years with just over $7 per rentable square foot and TIâ€™s incentives. we experienced some modest small tenant attrition during the quarter due to COVID resulting in a net loss of approximately 16,000 rentable square feet or less than a half a point of occupancy, none of which was lost to a competitor. our outlook moving forward is one of the positive net absorption, with two of our proposal activity picking up significantly. And we are encouraged by the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space in UTC. on
