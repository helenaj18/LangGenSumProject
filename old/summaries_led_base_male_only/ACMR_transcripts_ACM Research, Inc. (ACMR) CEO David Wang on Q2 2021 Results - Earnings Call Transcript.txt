 we report record revenue of 54 million in the second quarter of 2021 and 82 million in the first quarter of 2021. 
 we delivered a good balance of growth and profitability with 40.5% gross margin and 10.4% operating margin. 
 we delivered three first tools in the quarter and we expect more revenue contribution in the back half of the year. Revenue for single wafer cleaning tools, which include our flagship single wafer cleaning tools and our semi-critical cleaning tools, was 45.5 million, up 36.4% and 33.3 million. Revenue for advanced packaging, excluding eCP, services and spares, was 8.4 million, up from 1.2 million in 2020. Gross margin was 40.5% versus 49.7%. 
 this was at the lower end of our normal expectation range of 40% to 45%. 
 we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including product mix and manufacturing utilization. Operating income was 5.7 million, down from 8.2 million. Tax expense was $15,000 versus $1.9 million in the year-ago period. on the bottom line, we reported net income per diluted share of $0.19 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.29 in the same period last year.
