 during the second quarter, we continued our strong start to the year deploying significant capital across our three external growth platforms, maintaining near full occupancy and further solidifying our balance sheet. during the quarter, we invested approximately $324 million in 120 high-quality retail net leased properties across our three external growth platforms. 
 this includes the acquisition of 92 assets for approximately $305 million. 
 the weighted average cap rate was 6.8% relative to full year expansion and the weighted average term to close was approximately 10 years. 
 the weighted average annualized base rents acquired during the quarter were approximately 4.1x pro forma for the settlement of our outstanding forward equity. for the first half of this year, we have invested $638 million across 189 retail net lease properties spanning 36 states and 22 retail sectors. 
 close to three quarters of the annualized base rent acquired in the first six months of the year comes from leading investment grade retailers. 
 we anticipate our acquisition volume for the third quarter to be at least 1 billion and we anticipate our acquisition volume for the third year to be at least 1 billion.
