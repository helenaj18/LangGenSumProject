 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we delivered 9.5% core growth in revenue of $1.72 billion and 9.5% core growth in non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.27 on a reported basis. 
 our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. in the first half of the year, we were expecting double-digit core growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. 
 we now expect core revenue growth in the range of 3% to 4.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the range of 7% to 8% in the second half of the year. 
 our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. 
 we expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year.
