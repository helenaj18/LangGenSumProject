 during the fourth quarter and full year of 2021, we reported revenues of $26.4 million and $80.9 million, respectively, representing 92% year-over-year revenue growth and a gross profit of approximately 13% for the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 we also reported a consolidated net loss of $16.6 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $19.4 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2020. the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to a gross profit contribution of $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a gross loss of $5.2 million for the 4 months ended December 31, 2020. 
 the year-over-year revenue growth is primarily due to greater sales of our immunoglobulin products and intermediate fractions generated by our Boca Raton manufacturing segment operations in 2021 totaling $38.1 million as we concluded our second full year of commercial sales of BIVIGAM and ASCENIV. the recent approval of our fifth plasma collection center advances the company towards its goal of having 10 FDA-approved centers before the end of next year, which we believe will allow the company to potentially reach plasma supply self-sufficiency by year-end 2023. our 2021 operating and financial achievements mark a pivotal point in the business' evolution towards a profit-oriented growth organization. we believe the commercial, regulatory and operational milestones achieved during 2021 will serve as a strong foundation for ADMA to advance towards anticipated profitability no later than the first quarter of 2024.
