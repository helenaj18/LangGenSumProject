 we report third quarter 2021 net sales of $13.1 million reflecting the first full quarter of the launch of the zyndranzetram (zyndranzetram ) agent in third-line-plus relapsed or refractory diffuse large b - cell lymphoma. 
 we are now approximately six months into the launch and we are encouraged by what we have accomplished to date, delivering $13.1 million in net sales in our first quarter of the launch. 
 we have generated good momentum behind the launch driven by the unique product profile, the significant unmet need in third-line-plus DLBCL and the strong execution of our highly experienced team of sales and medical professionals. 
 we also continue to advance our pipeline that leverages our validated ADC platform applied to the treatment of solid tumors. on the clinical front, we continue to evaluate zyndranzetram ( zyndranzetram ) in combination with other agents in earlier line opportunities in third-line-plus and as a single agent in follicular lymphoma. 
 finally, we continue to advance our pipeline programs, which are important for long- term value for the company.
