On May 23, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against pharmaceutical company Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("AGILent"), alleging that it lost market share in the first half of fiscal year 2023.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Agilent's business in China, where it is headquartered, experienced a significant decline in orders in the first half of fiscal year 2023 due to slowing demand for its products.  The complaint alleges that Agilent's business in China was down 16% in the first half of fiscal year 2023, partially offset by strong orders in the second half of fiscal year 2023.  The complaint further alleges that Agilent's core values and approach were not reflected in the company's second half guidance.  The complaint, filed in the SEC's Southern District of New York, charges the company with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Agilent has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders from certain of its customers will cease to flow.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Doris Donnelly with the assistance of the Helenet Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Donnelly.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
