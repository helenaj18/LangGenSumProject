On May 21, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Agilent Technologies, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company based in Frederick, Maryland.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike McMullen, failed to adequately assess the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the company's core business.  The complaint alleges that, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Agilent Technologies reported a 5% decline in its core business.  The complaint further alleges that, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, Agilent Technologies had a 1% decline in its core business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges that Agilent Technologies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Agilent Technologies and its President and Chief Executive Officer have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders from Agilent Technologies will be processed at a later date.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Tycho Margaretson and Michelle Donnelly of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.  The litigation will be handled by Mr. Margaretson and Mr. Donnelly.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Secret Service.  The SEC thanks the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy for its assistance in this matter.
