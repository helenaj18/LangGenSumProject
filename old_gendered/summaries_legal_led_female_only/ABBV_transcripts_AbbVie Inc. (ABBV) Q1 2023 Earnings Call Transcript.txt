On April 27, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against AbbVie, Inc. ("AbbVie"), alleging that AbbVie violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that AbbVie violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that AbbVie violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint further alleges that AbbVie violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against AbbVie.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AbbVie with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint also charges AbbVie with violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and charges AbbVie with violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  The complaint charges AbbVie with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act, and Sections 206(1) and 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, AbbVie has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Terence Flynn with the assistance of Chedly C. Dumornay.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
