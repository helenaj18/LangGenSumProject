On October 31, 2019, the SEC filed its third quarter 2019 earnings release with the SEC.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Hurricane Irma and other severe weather events caused significant declines in the company's core business.  The SEC's complaint alleges that UPC Insurance, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, UPC Insurance Holdings Corp., lost approximately $1.05 per share in after-tax cat losses in the third quarter of 2019.  According to the complaint, the company's reserves for these events were conservatively set at $40 million and $30 million, respectively.  The complaint alleges that the company's reserves for these events were not adequate.  The complaint further alleges that the company's reserves for those events were not sufficient.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the SEC's Orlando Regional Office, alleges that UPC Insurance violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC Insurance has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1.05 per share.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Greg Christinas of Denise Rebecca, with assistance from Debra Forney of the SEC's Amyet Abuse Unit.  The litigation will be led by Mr. Christinas.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
