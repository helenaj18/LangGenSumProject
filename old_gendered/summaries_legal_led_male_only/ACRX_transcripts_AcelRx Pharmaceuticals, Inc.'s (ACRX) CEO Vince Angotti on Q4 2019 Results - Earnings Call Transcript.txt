On March 16, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRX), alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that AcelRx and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint further alleges that AcelRx failed to comply with the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges AcelRx and Tetraphase with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The complaint also charges AcelRx with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges AcelRx with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint charges AcelRx with violations of Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, AcelRx and Tetraphase consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Higgins of the SEC's New York Regional Office.  The litigation will be led by Raffi Asadorian.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services.
