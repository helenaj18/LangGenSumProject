On August 5, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that China-based microcap manufacturer ACM Research, Inc. ("ACM") has agreed to pay over $1.5 billion to acquire ACM for a total of $1.5 billion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that China-based ACM was not able to access ACM's supply chain to meet demand for its core cleaning products.  The complaint further alleges that ACM was unable to access ACM's supply chain because of a supply chain constraint.  The complaint further alleges that ACM did not acquire ACM's core cleaning products.  The SEC's complaint charges ACM with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, ACM has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gary Dvorchak, David Wang, and Chua Teng of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.
