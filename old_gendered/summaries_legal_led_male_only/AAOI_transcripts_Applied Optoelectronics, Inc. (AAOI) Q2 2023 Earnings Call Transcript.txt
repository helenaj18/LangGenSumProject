On August 3, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. ("AOI"), a microcap company based in Atlanta, Ga., has agreed to be acquired by Microsoft for $300 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Georgia, alleges that, between June 30 and August 31, 2017, AOI raised approximately $1.2 million from at least 10 customers in connection with the acquisition of a large data center business. The complaint further alleges that, while the acquisition was not imminent, AOI's revenue increased substantially in the second quarter, and the company's gross margin and non-GAAP loss per share increased substantially sequentially.  The SEC's complaint charges AOI with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint charges AOI with violations of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaint charges AOI with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, AOI has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-5 thereunder.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Tim Savageaux and Graham Loomis of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Lindsay Savarese. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
