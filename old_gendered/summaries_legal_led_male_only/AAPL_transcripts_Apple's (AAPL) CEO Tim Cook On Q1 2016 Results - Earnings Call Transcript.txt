On January 26, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that Apple Inc. ("AAPL") announced record quarterly revenue and earnings per share for its services business.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Apple's revenue and earnings per share declined significantly in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Apple failed to invest in its core services business, which includes iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.  The complaint alleges that Apple failed to invest adequately in its core services business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court, charges Apple with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Apple has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Gary Paxton, Mark Moskowitz, and Jim Suva of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
