On May 8, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Absolute Software Corporation for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Absolute Software violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated Rule 17(a) of the Exchange Act.  The complaint alleges that Absolute Software violated Rule 17(a) and (c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Absolute has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1.4 million, prejudgment interest of $600,000, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Kim and Richard Tse of the SEC's Cyber Unit, and the litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
