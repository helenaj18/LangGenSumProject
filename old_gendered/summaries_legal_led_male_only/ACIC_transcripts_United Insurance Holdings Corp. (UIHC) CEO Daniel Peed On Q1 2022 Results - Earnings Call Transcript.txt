On May 9, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") announced that it has filed an application to merge with American Coastal Insurance Company ("ACIC") to create a new entity that will be able to offer reinsurance services to more than 100,000 insured customers.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in the first quarter, UPC Insurance reported a net loss of $29.3 million, a decrease of $15.4 million or 21% year-over-year.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, in the prior year, UPC Insurance had a net loss of $29.3 million and a net loss of $19.4 million.  The SEC's complaint charges UPC Insurance with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UPC Insurance has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Gregory Peters, Bill Donohue, and Bill Donohue of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.  The litigation is continuing.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
