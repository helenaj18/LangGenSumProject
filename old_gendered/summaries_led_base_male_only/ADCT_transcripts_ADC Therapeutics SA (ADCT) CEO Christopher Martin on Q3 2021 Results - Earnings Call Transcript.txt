 we report third quarter 2021 net sales of $13.1 million and discuss our progress on the launch of zyndranatib (zyndranatib ) in third-line-plus relapsed or refractory diffuse large bile cell lymphoma (DLBCL ). 
 we are now approximately six months into the launch and we are encouraged by what we have accomplished to date, delivering $13.1 million in net sales in our first quarter of the launch. 
 we have generated good momentum behind the launch driven by the unique product profile, the significant unmet need in third-line-plus DLBCL and the strong execution of our highly experienced team of sales and medical professionals. 
 we also continue to advance our pipeline that leverages our validated antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) platform applied to the treatment of solid tumors.
