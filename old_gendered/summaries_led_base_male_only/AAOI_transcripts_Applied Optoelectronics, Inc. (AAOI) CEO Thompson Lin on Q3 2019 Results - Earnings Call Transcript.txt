 we report third quarter 2019 revenue of $46.1 million and non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million or a loss of $0.15 per basic share. 
 our gross margin was 28.8% in the third quarter and at the high end of our guidance range of 27% to 29% primarily driven by operational efficiencies and a favorable product mix. 
 we continue to make good progress in diversifying our customer base, and during the quarter we secured eleven design wins including four from new customers. on a year-to-date basis, the concentration of revenue among our top 10 customers decreased from 94% to 89%. 
 this decreasing revenue concentration is in line with our expectations and reflects the positive trend for our business. in the third quarter, 69% of our datacenter revenue was from our 40G transceiver products and 25% was from our 100G products. 
 we continue to see early signs of recovery among two of our hyperscale datacenter customers while one customer continues to purchase from us but with reduced demand. 
 we are encouraged by this sign and believe the fundamental need for higher bandwidth within hyperscale datacenters will drive long-term growth. in addition to our standard Remote PHY products, we also demonstrated a pathway to Extended Spectrum DOCSIS using our Remote PHY technology. 
 we believe this latest DOCSIS standard will be a catalyst for future upgrades and we believe we are well position to capitalize on this implementation once it began.
