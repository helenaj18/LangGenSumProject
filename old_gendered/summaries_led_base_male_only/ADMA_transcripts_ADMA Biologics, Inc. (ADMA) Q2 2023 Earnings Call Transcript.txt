 we remain confident in sustaining our growth trajectory throughout the remainder of 2023 and beyond in terms of adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth.    
 we also report on progress in advancing growth opportunities that will, if successful, further enhance our position in the market and increase our potential earnings power.    
 we believe our continued success in the 10 billion immunoglobulin end market is attributable to our innovative business model, unique product portfolio, targeted medical education efforts and most importantly, our core focus on treating underserved immune deficient patient populations.
