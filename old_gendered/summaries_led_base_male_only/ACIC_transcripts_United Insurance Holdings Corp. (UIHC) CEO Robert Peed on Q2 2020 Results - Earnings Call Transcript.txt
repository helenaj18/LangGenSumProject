 we report results for the second quarter ended on the 30th of november, 2020. 
 we report core income of $8.8 million or $0.20 a share and gross premiums earned of approximately $344 million, an increase of $14 million or a little over 4% from the same period a year ago. 
 our underlying combined ratio of 99.4% improved 8.8% year-over-year, which included 16 points of current year catastrophe losses, totaling $29.8 million, and a modest favorable reserve development of $823,000, leading to an underlying combined ratio of 83.7%, which compares very favorably to 91.8% last year. 
 our non-cat loss ratio of 29.5% improved 5.7 points year-over-year and a net loss ratio of 54.8% improved over 6 points compared to the second quarter last year. 
 these improvements were fueled by favorable non-cat loss frequency and lower policy acquisition costs.
