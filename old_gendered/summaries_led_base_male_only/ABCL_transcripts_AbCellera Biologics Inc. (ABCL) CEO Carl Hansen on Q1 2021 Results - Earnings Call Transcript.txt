 we report on our first quarter 2021 financial results and provide an outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our net earnings were $117 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020. in terms of earnings per share, this works out to a basic earnings of $0.43 per share and diluted earnings of $0.37 per share. Revenue in the quarter was nearly $203 million, 44 times what it was in the first quarter of 2020. as a result of the success of bamlanivimab, we now have 16 programs under contract across three partners effectively. 
 we expect to continue to see a robust number of program starts in 2021, with the increase in program starts as the leading indicator of this. in addition, we expect to continue to generate a portfolio of hundreds of royalty positions forging new partnerships and expanding our work with existing partners. 
 we also expect to continue to see a healthy mix of partners and targets per program.
