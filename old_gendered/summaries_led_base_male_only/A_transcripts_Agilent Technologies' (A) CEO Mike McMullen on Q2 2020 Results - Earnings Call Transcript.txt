 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we were among the first to discuss the business impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities. as the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost trucker through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. we also took swift action to reduce expenses to respond to the impact of the pandemic.    in the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered revenues of $1.24 billion, flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. on a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. on a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter with Europe down 4, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat.    on the diagnostics side, we posted 4% core growth in the quarter with increasing strength throughout the quarter. And we expect that growth to continue throughout the year
