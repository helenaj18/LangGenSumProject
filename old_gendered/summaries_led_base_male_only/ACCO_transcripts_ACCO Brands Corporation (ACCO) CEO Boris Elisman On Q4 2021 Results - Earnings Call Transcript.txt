 we report results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and discuss our outlook for the full year of 2022. 
 our 2021 reported net sales increased 22% to $2.03 billion, largely due to the contribution from the acquisition of PowerA. Adjusted net income was $137 million and adjusted EPS was $1.41, a $0.46 improvement versus prior year. Foreign exchange added 2%. 
 our comparable sales rose 5% as we had higher pricing and improved volume in most markets. the 5% comparable sales growth for our total business was higher than our expected long-term sales growth of 2% to 4% due to the economic recovery. 
 our adjusted gross margin improved by 80 basis points to 13.5% due to our focus on cost reductions and also lower inventory charges. 
 we expect to continue to help margins by our continuous productivity programs and expect to again deliver approximately $30 million in full year expense savings. 
 we expect to return to a historically more balanced capital allocation that will include dividends, debt reduction and opportunistic repurchases of our shares. 
 we expect our free cash flow to be at least $165 million, cash from operations of at least $190 million and CapEx of $25 million.
