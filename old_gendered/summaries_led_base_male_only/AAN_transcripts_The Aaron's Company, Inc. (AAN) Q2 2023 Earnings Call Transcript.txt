 the Aaronâ€™s Company, Inc. (NYSE:AAN ) reported second quarter earnings for the second quarter of 2023 that were ahead of internal expectations, driven in part by our ongoing focus on cost controls. we also benefited from a healthier lease portfolio resulting from optimization of our lease decisioning model in prior quarters. These items contributed significantly to our strong bottomline performance in the second quarter, offsetting continued challenging customer demand trends. during the quarter, we generated $53 million in cash flow from operations and improved the strength of our balance sheet by reducing net debt by over $30 million. in the second quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues for the consolidated company to be between $2.12 billion and $2.22 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%.
