 we report a net loss of $33.2 million or $0.77 a share for the first quarter of 2022, which includes a core loss of $29.3 million or $0.68 a share and includes $28.6 million of current accident year net retained cat losses and $1.4 million of prior year reserved development driven primarily by cat events. gross premiums written for the quarter of $279.5 million declined $32.2 million or approximately 10% and gross premiums earned a $319.2 million decreased 11% due in part to the continued exposure management in our personal lines portfolio, as well as the cancellation of all policies in New Jersey, consistent with our plan to transfer that business to HCI Group.
