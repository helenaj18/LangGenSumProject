 we report results for the first quarter of 2022 and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
 our first quarter results were in line with our internal expectations and what we indicated on our fourth quarter call. Orders in the quarter were up year-over-year 150% organically, which represented an acceleration from the 67% growth we recognized in the fourth quarter and the 55% growth we saw in the year of 2021. Organic volume growth contributed approximately 21.3% to net sales and the acquisition of BasX Solutions contributed 18.1% with the remainder coming mainly from price increases. 
 our gross profit increased 38.9% to $46.1 million from $33.2 million. Gross margin benefited from a $1.8 million noncash income related to the extending the useful lives of some of our equipment. Excluding this item, gross margin was 24.2% compared to 28.6% in the first quarter of 2021. on a sequential basis, gross margin improved substantially from the fourth quarter of 2021. We are still not where we want to be, but the first quarter was in line with our internal expectations and we are on track to achieving target margins later this year. Supply chain issues are easing. And we are seeing some improvement in our lead times. 
 our parts business was up 36.1% in the first quarter to the highest level of any first quarter in company history. 
 our headcount in the legacy business is up 17% year-over-year and 457 people that we added in the year-over-year that we were helping the legacy plant with large lead times were helping the new plant with large lead times. 
 we expect to see this sort of book of business really ramp up in the second half of the year. in general, using first quarter as a benchmark, we foresee sales margins and earnings will improve throughout the year, with the bulk of the improvement occurring in the back half.
