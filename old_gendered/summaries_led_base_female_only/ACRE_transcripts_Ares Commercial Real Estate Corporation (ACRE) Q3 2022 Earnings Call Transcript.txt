 we report third quarter distributable earnings of $0.39 per share, an increase of 5% from the third quarter of last year, which exceeded our quarterly regular and supplemental dividends paid of $0.35 per share. the primary driver of the difference between our third quarter GAAP EPS and distributable EPS is approximately $19.5 million or about $0.36 per share in credit enhancement credit loss (CECL ) provision we recorded during the quarter. in terms of our overall reserve, we increased our total reserve by $19.5 million as of the third quarter of 2022 and our total CECL reserve now stands at $51.9 million or 1.9% of our total loan commitments. during the third quarter, we closed $50 million of floating rate investments across multifamily and self-storage properties and $28 million of newly issued AAA-rated, newly issued liquid debt securities.
