 this is a transcript of the third quarter 2019 results conference call for the company and its subsidiary, the United Insurance Holdings Corporation (UIHC ). 
 the company reported a loss of $58.2 million or $1.05 a share in the third quarter of 2019 and a combined ratio of 24.9% or $11.61 excluding unrealized gains. 
 cat losses of $58.2 million were the driver of results for this quarter adding over 30 points to the combined ratio adding over 30 points to the underlying combined ratio year over year. However, the underlying loss and combined ratios showed significant improvement compared to the same period a year ago. 
 the gross and net underlying loss ratios improved 4.3 and 7.3 points, respectively, from the third quarter of 2018, which also drove a six point improvement in the underlying combined ratio year over year. 
 this was driven by continued strong organic growth in both personal and commercial lines and improvement in underlying results as the cumulative effect of rate increases, claims handling and underwriting initiatives takes hold in our book.
