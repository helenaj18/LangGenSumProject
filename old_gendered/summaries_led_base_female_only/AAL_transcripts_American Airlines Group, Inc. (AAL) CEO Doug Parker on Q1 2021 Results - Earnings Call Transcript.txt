 we report a first quarter net loss of $1.3 billion or $1.97 per share, excluding net special items of $3.5 billion. 
 this loss was driven by the extreme drop in demand for air travel due to the global pandemic. 
 our revenues in the quarter were down 62% from the same period in 2019. on the cost side, we have reduced our first quarter total operating expense, excluding net special items, by 26% versus 2020 on a 39% reduction in total capacity. 
 we expect second quarter total capacity to be down approximately 20% to 25% versus second quarter of 2019. with these capacity and demand assumptions, we expect a significant increase in our revenue versus the first quarter with our total revenue to be down approximately 40% versus the second quarter of 2019. on the revenue side, we have continued to outperform our competitors in the first quarter and we expect to continue to outperform in the third quarter as well as in the fourth quarter. 
 we also expect to have our best lTR year since the merger in 2021 and beyond. 
 finally, we discuss some of the strategies we are taking to prepare the airline for the return to a more normal business environment.
