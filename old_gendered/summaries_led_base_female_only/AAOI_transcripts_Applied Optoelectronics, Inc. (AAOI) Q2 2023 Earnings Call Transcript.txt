 we report on our second quarter 2023 financial results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. 
 our second quarter revenue was in line with our expectations, while our non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP loss per share were better than our expectations. 
 our non-GAAP gross margin was 24.8% in the second quarter of 2023 and was up from 23.2% in the first quarter of 2023. 
 our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.21, above our balanced range of a loss of $0.23 to $0.31. during the quarter, we continued to see increased demand for our 100 and 400 gig products in our data center business and we also saw a significant increase in our 100 and 400 gig revenue in our telecom business. 
 we expect our data center revenue to increase slightly sequentially in the third quarter of 2023, although it will be down year-over-year off a record strong quarter of last year.
