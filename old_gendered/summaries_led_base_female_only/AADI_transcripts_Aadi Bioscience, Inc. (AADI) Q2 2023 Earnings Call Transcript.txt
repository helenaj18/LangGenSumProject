 we report on our financial and operational results for the second quarter of 2023 and provide an update on our clinical and commercial activities during the period.    
 we continue to see solid performance from our commercial and clinical organizations during the quarter, each focused on driving results as we enter the second half of the year. FYARRO sales for the quarter were $6.2 million, showing continued growth with a 6% sequential increase over the previous quarter and 80% growth over the prior year quarter.  we are seeing steady demand for the product in the first-line setting with more than 90% of our commercial accounts being covered on a reorder basis.    
 we also continue to evaluate the potential use of nab-sirolimus in a number of new clinical indications, either as a single agent or in combination with other target therapies.    
 we are excited about our new programs in endometrial cancer and neuroendocrine tumors and the prospects for our next-generation mTOR inhibitor in these indications with meaningful patient populations and high unmet need.    
 we will now open the line for questions.
