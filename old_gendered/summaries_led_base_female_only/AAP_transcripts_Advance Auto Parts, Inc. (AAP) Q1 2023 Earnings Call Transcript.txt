 we report first quarter net sales of $1.1 billion and comparable store sales of negative 1% to flat, driven by new store openings and strong growth in our e-commerce business. 
 gross profit margin was 43% compared with 44.6% in the previous year. on a rate basis, gross margin declined 2.6% compared with 6% in the previous year. 
 the single biggest driver of that was price realization in the first quarter, which was below our expectations due to the competitive environment in the professional sales channel. 
 we expect that to moderate over the balance of the year. 
 we also incurred a headwind associated with the prior year adjustments which will provide savings balance of year within SG&A.
