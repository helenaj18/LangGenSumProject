 acelrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRX ) reported net revenues of $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2020 and cash operating expenses of $8.4 million excluding stock-based compensation.    
 this includes a net benefit of $0.5 million from the receipt of a breakup fee from the Tetraphase acquisition, net of expenses incurred related to the transaction in the second quarter of 2019.    
 we continue to build our foundation for future profitable growth by advancing the use of dSUVIA throughout the Department of Defense and by establishing partnerships in large specialty markets outside the hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings.    
 this progress is highlighted by our successful Milestone C approval in April, that opens the door for purchases from the U.S. Army as well as our recent distribution and promotion agreement with Zimmer Biomet for the management of acute pain in adults during dental and oral surgeries.
