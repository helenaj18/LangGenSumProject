 this is a transcript of the first quarter 2021 ACCO Brands earnings conference call. 
 we will discuss our first quarter results and outlook, and then we will open the line for questions. 
 our first quarter sales were up 7% as a result of the acquisition of the leading player in video gaming accessories such as controllers, power charging stations, and headphones, that we bought in late December 2020. Comparable sales declined approximately 13% in the first quarter of this year. 
 we expect growth in both the second quarter and the second half of the year. 
 our first quarter adjusted net income was $10 million or $0.10 per share versus $13 million or $0.14 per share last year. 
 the year-over-year decline was mainly the result of lower volume in North America and International, higher incentive accruals and logistics expense, and higher interest expense associated with the acquisition, that is benefiting EPS for our cost reduction efforts and better profits in EMEA. our free cash flow for this year is expected to be at least $135 million. 
 we expect to use the majority of our free cash flow this year to reduce debt and with continued improvement in sales growth, and lower debt, we should reduce our year-end leverage ratio to approximately 3.5 times, which is where it was prior to purchasing PowerA.
