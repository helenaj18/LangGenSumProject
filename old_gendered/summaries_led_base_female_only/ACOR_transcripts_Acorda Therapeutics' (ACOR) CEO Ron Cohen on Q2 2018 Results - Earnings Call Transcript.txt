 this is a transcript of the second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. 
 we are participating in this call to provide an update on the status of the company and to provide an outlook for the second half of the year and beyond. 
 we will also provide an outlook for the second half of 2018 and beyond. 
 we ended the quarter with over $300 million in cash and are well capitalized for anticipated launch of INBRIJA in the second half of the year. 
 we expect to build further value with the potential approval of INBRIJA in Europe, and we plan to develop additional therapeutics that harness the power of the ARCUS pulmonary drug delivery technology.
